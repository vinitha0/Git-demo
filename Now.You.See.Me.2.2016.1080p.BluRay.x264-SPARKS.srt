1
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:34,287
Excuse me. Sorry. I'm sorry.

2
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,089
Excuse me. Coming through.

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,889
<i>Tonight, so-called
magician Lionel Shrike</i>

4
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:42,440
<i>is making another sad
attempt for attention</i>

5
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:45,882
<i>by performing what he calls
an impossible feat.</i>

6
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:48,247
<i>The safe is made of
the strongest iron.</i>

7
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,569
<i>It can't be sawed through or pried.</i>

8
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,929
<i>Yet, Lionel Shrike thinks
he's able to escape.</i>

9
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,843
Dad! Dad!

10
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,682
Hey, buddy.
You made it, huh?

11
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,162
Now, see that seat there?

12
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:08,730
It's the best
seat in the house.

13
00:01:08,800 --> 00:01:13,044
Is Lionel Shrike the kind
of magician who can pull this off?

14
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:16,010
<i>Or is he actually
in over his head?</i>

15
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,684
We'll see about that.

16
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,081
- What's the matter?
- I don't want you to go.

17
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,322
Dylan, come on.
We talked about this.

18
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,721
Remember?
This is what I do.

19
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:27,280
I got to prove all
those naysayers wrong.

20
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,170
Okay? Besides...

21
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:33,323
I always keep something up my sleeve.

22
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,482
Now, got your watch
like your dad's?

23
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:39,005
- Okay. How many seconds?
- Three hundred.

24
00:01:39,080 --> 00:01:41,765
Three hundred. Maybe a few less.

25
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:47,003
I love you so much.

26
00:01:48,800 --> 00:01:51,690
Okay. See you later, big man.

27
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:56,402
Ladies and gentlemen,
Lionel Shrike!

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,968
Will he be able
to hold his breath?

29
00:02:00,040 --> 00:02:03,726
Will he be able to
somehow escape the safe?

30
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:09,521
Three, two, one...

31
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,365
Two, three,

32
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,002
four, five, six,
seven, eight...

33
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:28,889
296... 297, 298, 299, 300.

34
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:35,125
303, 304...

35
00:02:36,240 --> 00:02:37,890
<i>It's five minutes now,</i>

36
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:43,329
<i>and we have not seen or heard
anything from Lionel Shrike yet.</i>

37
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:44,561
Move!

38
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,001
Dad!

39
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,760
Dad! Dad!

40
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:54,085
Let go of me!

41
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:56,081
Dad!

42
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:59,243
No! Dad!

43
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,408
Dad! Let go!

44
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:04,766
Find him!

45
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:26,166
<i>The Eye.</i>

46
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,883
<i>It may not lie...</i>

47
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:32,487
<i>But don't think for a moment
that it can't be lied to.</i>

48
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,084
<i>Seeing is believing.</i>

49
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:39,083
<i>But is it truth?</i>

50
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,887
<i>People see the Horsemen
as noble Robin Hoods. Are they?</i>

51
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:46,451
<i>Or are they common thieves?</i>

52
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,806
<i>Depends on your point of view.</i>

53
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,045
<i>Here's what you know.</i>

54
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,681
<i>They robbed a bank in Paris
from a stage in Las Vegas.</i>

55
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:56,410
<i>They fleeced
an insurance magnate</i>

56
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,050
<i>of hundreds of
millions of dollars</i>

57
00:03:58,120 --> 00:04:00,771
<i>and disappeared from
a roof in New York.</i>

58
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,084
<i>Always showering their
devoted fans with money.</i>

59
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,049
<i>Here's what you don't know.</i>

60
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,248
<i>They left one man behind.</i>

61
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:12,767
<i>Framed. Holding the bag. Me.</i>

62
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,727
<i>Are you listening, Horsemen?</i>

63
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,963
<i>When you emerge, and you will,</i>

64
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,089
<i>I will be there waiting.</i>

65
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:29,411
<i>Because mark my words,
you will get what's coming to you.</i>

66
00:04:29,480 --> 00:04:31,847
<i>In ways you can't expect.</i>

67
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:34,842
<i>But very much deserve.</i>

68
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:41,764
<i>Because one thing I believe in
is an eye for an eye.</i>

69
00:05:59,200 --> 00:06:01,043
<i>Welcome, Daniel Atlas.</i>

70
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,446
Who am I speaking to?

71
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:06,928
I asked to see the face
behind all of this.

72
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,283
<i>You've asked many questions.
And registered many complaints.</i>

73
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,283
<i>You can rest assured
that we've heard you.</i>

74
00:06:14,360 --> 00:06:15,885
Have you? Because I don't--

75
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,291
<i>- Trust?</i>
- No.

76
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:20,091
<i>Your leader?
Your fellow Horsemen?</i>

77
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:21,650
<i>Perhaps even us?</i>

78
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:25,691
I don't like that we've been
living in hiding for a year.

79
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:27,967
I don't like that every message
I get from Dylan is,

80
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,691
"Wait. Be patient.
The Eye has a plan."

81
00:06:30,760 --> 00:06:33,161
<i>Wait. Be patient.</i>

82
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:34,446
<i>The Eye has a plan.</i>

83
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:37,490
This is games
and it's not working for me.

84
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:42,482
<i>You feel it is you who should be
leading the Horsemen, not Dylan.</i>

85
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:48,041
<i>If that is what you desire,
stay the course.</i>

86
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,122
<i>Trust that your unique talents</i>

87
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:54,000
<i>and remarkable mind
will not go unrecognized.</i>

88
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,686
<i>We have a new mission
for the Horsemen.</i>

89
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,843
<i>Dylan has a plan
and will gather you together soon.</i>

90
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:02,730
<i>Now leave!</i>

91
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,530
...North Carolina,
Florida, Maryland, Maine.

92
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:21,489
We're talking the entire
eastern seaboard.

93
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:23,483
I need to see some results.

94
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:25,369
Oh, hey. Oh, sorry.

95
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,488
Just real quick. Can I have you
for a couple of minutes?

96
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:29,210
I'm right in the middle
of something, Dylan.

97
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,601
No, I know. It's okay. Hey. Hey,
everybody. Sorry. Sorry about that.

98
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,281
Call the mayor.

99
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,761
Thanks a lot.
Twins, huh? Good.

100
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,011
Is he coming?

101
00:07:39,080 --> 00:07:41,162
Look, I wouldn't have
brought you out of that meeting

102
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:42,730
unless it was something important.

103
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,167
It's about the Horsemen.

104
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,403
Something's happening here
and it's happening now.

105
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,165
Message boards.
Elite magic society.

106
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,681
There is chatter going on
about the Horsemen

107
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:57,003
and something happening with Octa,
the giant software company.

108
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,121
I know what Octa is.

109
00:07:58,200 --> 00:07:59,850
I'm sorry, ma'am,
but two months ago

110
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,888
we sent men to Philadelphia
because he knew...

111
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,287
- And I said that I was wrong.
- He knew that the Horsemen

112
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,964
were going to hit
the Euro-Atlantic Banking Summit.

113
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,041
- I have proof.
- Let him talk.

114
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,327
Thank you.
Communications.

115
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:13,405
Contact between who I think
might be Daniel Atlas

116
00:08:13,480 --> 00:08:16,165
and who may be Merritt McKinney.

117
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:19,608
And what do you have?
Emails? Cell phones? Any transcripts?

118
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,842
- Pigeons.
- What?

119
00:08:21,920 --> 00:08:24,207
I'm sorry,
you mean stool pigeons?

120
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,931
No, I mean actual pigeon pigeons.
Like carrier pigeons.

121
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,970
- Okay? Magicians work with pigeons.
- Doves.

122
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:32,491
Stay with me.

123
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:35,762
This pigeon, right here...

124
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,446
There's Daniel Atlas.
Same pigeon.

125
00:08:38,520 --> 00:08:39,601
East Village.

126
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,284
Same pigeon, West Village.

127
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,125
42nd Street, pigeon. 65th Street.

128
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,090
All the way up to the
George Washington Bridge

129
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:51,768
on a sail boat with a guy that looks
just like Merritt McKinney.

130
00:08:51,840 --> 00:08:53,251
And what does this all mean?

131
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,766
I know what it means.
It means nothing. It's bullshit.

132
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,524
- Could you sing a new song?
- No.

133
00:08:57,640 --> 00:08:59,051
How is it that two years ago
you were so close...

134
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:02,328
You think I went out of my way
to screw up my own investigation?

135
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:03,606
You think I'm
that big of an idiot?

136
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:05,170
You know what I think now?
I think you're smart,

137
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,446
but you want everybody else
to think that you're an idiot.

138
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,488
Okay, stop.

139
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,609
Cowan, I know I'm new here,
but as far as I can tell,

140
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,921
people who don't even know you,
think you're an asshole.

141
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,331
- And you?
- Ma'am.

142
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:20,325
You don't know me, but my first year
in the Academy, you gave a talk.

143
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:24,803
The "long game" you called it.
You talked about a moral compass.

144
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,087
About how you believed
in yours immutably.

145
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:34,245
And I thought to myself, "That guy.
One day, I want to be that guy."

146
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,406
And now... A pigeon?

147
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,687
Technically, it was a few pigeons,
but I hear what you're saying.

148
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,285
Okay. So here's what I'm going to do.

149
00:09:42,360 --> 00:09:45,364
You want to take a vacation day?
Go on your own? Fine.

150
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:48,768
But I'm not going to devote resources
to another snipe hunt.

151
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:51,969
I came to clean this mess up,
not add to it. I'm sorry.

152
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:55,522
Boss, thank you. I promise you,
it won't be a snipe hunt.

153
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:57,648
We're gonna get those Horsemen.

154
00:09:58,040 --> 00:09:59,166
She's great.

155
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,403
The problem is when you're
two people at the same time,

156
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:03,925
one of them is bound
to trip the other.

157
00:10:04,040 --> 00:10:07,249
And when that happens,
I will be there.

158
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,080
Duly noted.

159
00:10:30,520 --> 00:10:32,090
- Oh. Hi!
- Who are you?

160
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,844
- What are you doing in my--
- It's actually a funny story.

161
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,524
How did you get into my apartment?
Whoa!

162
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,887
I think it's funny.
It's not like funny "ha ha."

163
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:40,088
Or you might not think
that it's funny "ha ha."

164
00:10:40,200 --> 00:10:42,441
I think it's funny.
I guess it's all kind of relative.

165
00:10:42,520 --> 00:10:44,443
I was actually...
No, that's not...

166
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:48,081
I made myself in the neighborhood
and now I'm here, and maybe...

167
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,081
Okay.

168
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,366
Seriously, how did you get in here?

169
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,841
Are you some kind of
crazed fan or something?

170
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,843
Oh, my God.
No, no, no, I recognize you.

171
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,083
You did that B-grade "geek magic" thing,
didn't you? You pulled a...

172
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,366
Pulled a hat out of the rabbit.

173
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:03,680
A hat out of the rabbit, that's right.

174
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:04,841
I know that it didn't work.

175
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:06,001
No, it was actually
kind of disgusting.

176
00:11:06,080 --> 00:11:07,525
It was way worse for the rabbit.

177
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:11,002
Well, your drop was obvious
and your body shell is flimsy.

178
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:14,448
So if you wouldn't mind crawling out
from under my couch and...

179
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:20,722
Ta-da! Now I'm sitting
over here. Crazy!

180
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,486
By the way, that rabbit thing?
That was eight years ago, okay?

181
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,244
I've gotten so much
better since then.

182
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:27,651
- Have you?
- Yeah.

183
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,245
Okay, come here.
What is it that you want?

184
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:30,970
I wanted to meet you.
Everybody, really.

185
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:32,644
I want to be a part
of the Eye, okay?

186
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:35,405
I said it. I do.
And I want to use my magic for good,

187
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,166
like you and Merritt
and Jack especially.

188
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,242
Oh, that's right.
I know that Jack is alive.

189
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,560
I know that he
faked his own death.

190
00:11:42,680 --> 00:11:45,524
I am a huge fan of faking deaths.
That was crazy!

191
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:47,165
What is this?
A trucker's hitch?

192
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,004
- Yeah.
- It's terrible.

193
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:51,162
- Embarrassing.
- Okay.

194
00:11:51,240 --> 00:11:54,210
By the way, I am so sorry
that Henley left you.

195
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:56,089
- God!
- Sorry.

196
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,766
That's actually a little better.
You know what I heard?

197
00:11:58,840 --> 00:11:59,966
- What?
- About Henley?

198
00:12:00,040 --> 00:12:02,566
I heard that she got tired
of waiting around.

199
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:05,166
She lost faith
and so she asked for an out,

200
00:12:05,240 --> 00:12:07,129
and the Eye gave it to her.

201
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:08,440
But who knows, right?

202
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:10,488
In matters of the heart,
so difficult to tell.

203
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:13,040
I mean, maybe she got sick of you.
You ever think about that?

204
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:14,451
Control issues?

205
00:12:14,520 --> 00:12:16,284
Maybe you just didn't
tie her up tight enough. Ow!

206
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,725
Here's what's going to happen.

207
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:20,127
You're going to stay
here and stop talking,

208
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,645
and I'm going to
make a phone call,

209
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,081
and in about five minutes,
some people are going...

210
00:12:30,640 --> 00:12:32,483
It's all in the wrist.

211
00:12:32,840 --> 00:12:35,889
Let the momentum
of the card do the work for you.

212
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:38,969
This last one I call the Stall.

213
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:43,370
Not bad.

214
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,010
Now you want to see
a thing of beauty?

215
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,809
- I do indeed.
- Here you go.

216
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,121
And bingo bango bongo.

217
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:53,811
That's good. No, no, no,
it's good to be positive

218
00:12:53,880 --> 00:12:55,405
despite making zero
progress in a year.

219
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,527
Yeah.

220
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,523
Whereas when it
comes to hypnotism,

221
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:01,046
the student has almost
become the master.

222
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,728
I like your confidence, but you might
say that you have the better teacher.

223
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:06,881
Yeah.

224
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,166
You're right.
You're right.

225
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:10,481
Your teacher definitely doesn't
know what he's doing.

226
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:12,523
By the way, was this
your card yesterday?

227
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,967
- In fact it was.
- I thought so.

228
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,610
That's not bad.

229
00:13:21,720 --> 00:13:24,087
If I can hypnotize Danny
before you hit him with a card,

230
00:13:24,160 --> 00:13:25,491
I get top bunk for a week.

231
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,483
Okay, that's a deal.

232
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:28,971
- Danny, what's up, man?
- Hey.

233
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:31,008
Stare at the palm of your hand
and as your eyes change focus,

234
00:13:31,120 --> 00:13:32,451
you will begin to notice...

235
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:33,521
Everything, because
I'm not hypnotized.

236
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,649
It's not working.
Please don't become him.

237
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,404
I didn't know you guys did party tricks

238
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,164
when there weren't floozies around
to impress.

239
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:44,689
Uh, I think we stopped trying to
impress floozies in, like, 1937.

240
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,848
Okay, somebody broke into my apartment,
all right?

241
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:48,684
Some amateur who knew
everything about me,

242
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,286
everything about Henley leaving,
and everything about us.

243
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,045
- That's her.
- Hey!

244
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,361
- Hi.
- You met Lula.

245
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:58,960
I've met her.
What is she doing here?

246
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:04,126
I'm the new Horseman!
I'm the girl Horseman.

247
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:06,881
Yeah!

248
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,526
Nobody. No excitement.
Jack? Anything?

249
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,568
Dylan, tell me
what's going on here.

250
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:17,248
Well, Lula's been on the underground
scene for the last decade,

251
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:18,970
and I think she
has some real talent,

252
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:21,042
and I'd like to try her on stage

253
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,248
- to balance out the duo.
- What?

254
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:24,651
No, are you serious, man?

255
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,688
After Henley left, you said I could
get back on stage again.

256
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:28,211
Not someone who just showed up.

257
00:14:28,280 --> 00:14:30,123
I told you I'd think about it,
and I have,

258
00:14:30,200 --> 00:14:32,407
and I really need you behind the scenes
with me for a little while longer.

259
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:34,687
Dylan, come on. I've been
behind the scenes my whole life.

260
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:38,526
Which is a crime, might I add.
Have you seen that man's face?

261
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:42,400
Much as I appreciate the addition
of some femininity to the group,

262
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,721
over and above what Atlas provides,

263
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,121
I think the real issue
is we've been in this...

264
00:14:47,240 --> 00:14:49,561
Yeah, the issue is that
we have been rehearsing for months

265
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,325
for something...
We don't even know what it is.

266
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:53,765
And you're going to
keep working until...

267
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:55,808
Until we work as a single organism.
I know, I've heard you say that.

268
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,086
The thing is, when you say that,

269
00:14:57,160 --> 00:14:59,640
I think what you're
referring to is us, not you.

270
00:14:59,720 --> 00:15:02,121
Listen, I'm getting my orders
directly from the Eye.

271
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,645
Okay? And then I give them to you.

272
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,245
Now, if you don't like that,
you're welcome to go.

273
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:08,051
No, I'm not going anywhere. But I'm...
Mmm. I'm taking care of myself.

274
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,451
Guys, can I just
weigh in here really quickly?

275
00:15:09,520 --> 00:15:11,010
Because I think I see
what's going on here.

276
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,924
You guys are this amazing,
tight-knit family unit.

277
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:16,321
- I'm a new person...
- We are anything but a family.

278
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:20,450
Okay, well, my mother literally
knifed my father in the neck one time.

279
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,488
So you are actually
a little bit like my family unit.

280
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:23,800
- Literally?
- But, yeah.

281
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,803
It was an accident,
I think.

282
00:15:25,880 --> 00:15:28,929
Okay. So, does this mean
we're actually going to do something?

283
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,082
Yes.

284
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:35,603
You've all heard of Octa
and their playboy CEO, Owen Case.

285
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:38,251
His partner, Walter Mabry,
died about a year ago.

286
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,049
You wanna know what all this
has been leading to?

287
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:41,167
Yeah.

288
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:43,607
Octa's hosting the launch
of the next-gen cell phone.

289
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,170
Once these phones
hit the streets,

290
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:48,084
they'll siphon their users'
information to the black market.

291
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:51,846
Meaning Octa's selling privacy
to up their profit.

292
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:54,844
So, the Eye has decided
to expose them for it.

293
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:57,002
Our mission
is to hijack the show.

294
00:15:57,840 --> 00:15:59,763
Rehearsal's over, guys.

295
00:15:59,840 --> 00:16:01,524
This is what we've
been waiting for.

296
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,045
Now it's time to get to work.

297
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:14,171
<i>Welcome, Octa insiders,
bloggers and journalists.</i>

298
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:17,528
<i>We're delighted that you've joined us
to participate in our special event.</i>

299
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,605
<i>Today marks the beginning of a bright
new journey in social networking.</i>

300
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:23,330
<i>Our latest product, Octa 8...</i>

301
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,165
Keys, cell phones,
iPads, in the bin.

302
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:28,129
Thank you, sir.

303
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:32,649
Can't have you texting,
tweeting, recording, or eating.

304
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,411
Sorry, we will take very good
care of it for you.

305
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:38,165
Oh, by the way.

306
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:39,924
Security memo from Case himself.

307
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:43,482
Couple of surprise guests.
Just follow his lead, yeah?

308
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:45,483
We're all good.
I'm heading to the control room.

309
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:47,050
All right. Thanks, Jack.

310
00:16:47,880 --> 00:16:51,521
- Atlas, go.
- No, Dylan, I can't...

311
00:16:51,600 --> 00:16:53,921
<i>- What? What's the problem?</i>
- No, there's too many people...

312
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,321
Atlas, I got Owen landing now.

313
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,811
Okay, I'm going now.

314
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,530
- Stop.
- Oh.

315
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,405
- Okay.
- Thanks.

316
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,767
Pascal, we need you in the kitchen.

317
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:24,729
Look, the speech is about freedom, okay?

318
00:17:24,800 --> 00:17:26,450
That's what we're trying
to sell here, is freedom.

319
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,885
Which part of that
do you not understand?

320
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:29,405
- I know, I'm sorry.
- For goodness sake!

321
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:32,086
Mr. Case, John from legal.
Just need your signature for release.

322
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,810
Thank you so much.

323
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,962
Just get it done
and get it back to me.

324
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:44,564
Hey there, buddy! Smile!

325
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:46,483
- Who are you? What the hell?
- Who am I?

326
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,927
It is picture day.
Did Julie not tell you it's picture day?

327
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,729
- Picture day? What are you...
- Company-wide policy.

328
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,569
- Look, I got a job to do.
- I have a job to do, too.

329
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,846
Hold on a second.
What is that?

330
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:54,967
I'm going to need some backup here.

331
00:17:55,040 --> 00:17:56,166
Who are you calling?
Hey! That's my ID.

332
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,321
Security, my name is--

333
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,890
- Bo Walsh, thank you.
- Hey, I'm Bo Walsh!

334
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,325
Not this guy.
He's not Bo Walsh.

335
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,401
Calm down, please.

336
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,050
Hey! Hey, what's going on?

337
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,645
This guy just came and
put a flashlight in my eyes.

338
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,927
I'm trying to do my job.
This guy, check his badge.

339
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:08,650
- Who is this guy?
- I'm Bo Walsh, not him.

340
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,722
It says here,
"Evans Mental Facility.

341
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,211
- Mark D. Stooge."
- Hold on a second.

342
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:13,321
I've never seen
this before in my life.

343
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:14,606
I'm sorry, Mr. Walsh.

344
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:15,920
- Come on, Mr. Stooge.
- Hold on. He's not Mr. Walsh!

345
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,809
- Come on. Let's go.
- What's going on here?

346
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:19,644
I'm Bo Walsh, not him!

347
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:23,964
God, you cannot trust anybody
in this city anymore, can you?

348
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:25,809
Get off me!
Look, I want to make a phone call.

349
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:27,769
- I want to call my boss!
- Hey, hey! What's going on?

350
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:29,808
I want to call my boss,
and this jackass...

351
00:18:29,920 --> 00:18:31,763
Hey! Make your phone call.
That's your right, sir.

352
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,087
That's my right.

353
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:36,003
- What the hell?
- You're crazy. Let's go.

354
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,730
This isn't my...
Where's my phone?

355
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,484
Where's my phone?

356
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,324
Atlas, Stooge has left
the building.

357
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,686
Okay.

358
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:45,411
The circuit board is ours.
I am leaving backstage.

359
00:18:48,040 --> 00:18:50,122
<i>Ladies and gentlemen, Owen Case.</i>

360
00:18:50,200 --> 00:18:52,806
All right. Lula, show these guys
what you're made of.

361
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:02,564
I can take over from here.
Clark says you're on break.

362
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,926
What break? Who's Clark?

363
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,650
"Who's Clark?" That's funny.

364
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,087
Imagine if I told Roger that,
he'd freak out.

365
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:10,083
- Don't do that!
- What?

366
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:11,491
Who the hell is Roger?

367
00:19:11,560 --> 00:19:13,085
Does Lisa know that
you don't know Roger?

368
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,446
- I don't know who Lisa is.
- Are you kidding again?

369
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:16,488
- You don't know who Lisa is now?
- No, I don't. Just get away.

370
00:19:16,560 --> 00:19:18,767
- That is a dangerous...
- You're ruining the meat.

371
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,365
Don't make me have to go to Brian!

372
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,965
- I don't know who Brian is!
- Why are you acting like this?

373
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,405
- I'll go straight to him.
- Give me--

374
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:26,448
Oh, my God!

375
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:30,850
<i>What are you doing to me?</i>

376
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,282
- Help me!
- Help her. Go!

377
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,166
Have some water.

378
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:39,965
I feel from your face
you're freaked by the flow of blood,

379
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,690
which is fully fixable in a snap

380
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,287
by focusing and following
the flow of my words

381
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,647
as you're flowing and floating,

382
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:50,644
which is why you're focusing
on my commands.

383
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:52,131
You got this far in life

384
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,806
by listening to one voice,
the voice in your head.

385
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:56,763
This is that voice.

386
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:00,645
Look at the light.

387
00:20:00,760 --> 00:20:03,570
Listen to your own voice.

388
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,724
Oh, my God.

389
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,124
Wow. What is that?
Is that a miracle towel?

390
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,884
Thank you so much.
Do you know what?

391
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,407
You have taught me that I'm not
cut out for this kind of work.

392
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,084
I quit!

393
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,884
Get another towel.

394
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,328
Thank you, and goodbye.

395
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,361
Oh, God.

396
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:33,727
Welcome everybody!

397
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:36,724
And now, the moment
that you've all been waiting for...

398
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:39,928
- Nice work, lady.
- Thanks.

399
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:43,049
Revolutionized music with Octa 2.

400
00:20:44,840 --> 00:20:47,730
I'm actually nervous,
and I'm not even going onstage.

401
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:50,007
You know, I've heard
that if you're nervous,

402
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,084
it can be really helpful
to picture each other naked.

403
00:20:53,160 --> 00:20:54,924
It's actually picture
the audience naked.

404
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:56,684
No, this is new.
This is a new science.

405
00:20:56,760 --> 00:20:58,091
So, I don't know.

406
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:01,369
- Do you want... We should try it.
- Not the right mood.

407
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:03,044
Guess that leaves
you and me, old buddy.

408
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,930
What? Picture each other...
No. No, thank you.

409
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,967
I mean, I admit,
from the neck up there are issues.

410
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:12,163
But from the neck down, the David.

411
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:13,685
Owen Case.

412
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:19,167
Good morning, Octa-lites.

413
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:21,690
Now, I've made the claim...

414
00:21:21,800 --> 00:21:24,531
<i>Now, I've made the claim
that Octa 8 is pure magic.</i>

415
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,649
But the truth is, that's just
one of those things I say...

416
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:31,122
<i>You know, the truth is,
that's just one of those things I say...</i>

417
00:21:31,200 --> 00:21:33,441
...when in fact
I mean something else.

418
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:37,724
<i>...when in fact
I mean something else.</i>

419
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,086
What else do I mean?

420
00:21:39,160 --> 00:21:45,441
<i>Well, here to fill you in on some of my
fabulous lies and hypocrisy,</i>

421
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:49,491
<i>and to perform some of the most dazzling
feats of magic you have ever seen...</i>

422
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,166
- They are the world's...
<i>- ...greatest magicians.</i>

423
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,005
<i>Here to expose me
for the fraud I truly am.</i>

424
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:59,404
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
here are the Horsemen.</i>

425
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,004
Hello, New York!

426
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:17,009
Thank you so much.

427
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,844
Hey, it's great to be back.

428
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:22,208
And have you met
our newest Horseman, Lula?

429
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,286
- Feels good, right?
- Pretty good. Pretty good.

430
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,489
Thank you, thank you. Um, okay.

431
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,324
We want to talk to you
about your privacy.

432
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,402
What does your privacy mean to you?

433
00:22:37,480 --> 00:22:40,245
Because apparently to Owen Case,
it means absolutely nothing.

434
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,766
No, actually it means less
than absolutely nothing.

435
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,929
You see, he's mocked your privacy.
He's scorned it.

436
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:49,004
Right, and we're not just talking about
the things that you already agreed to

437
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,287
when you signed,
probably without reading

438
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,569
the terms and conditions
of Octas 1 through 7.

439
00:22:58,280 --> 00:23:01,124
Dylan, the FBI is here.

440
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,521
All right. Don't worry about it.

441
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:05,602
All right, go to plan C-4.

442
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,723
Lock the doors.

443
00:23:08,800 --> 00:23:10,404
Hey, boss, I'm glad you're here.

444
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:11,891
Don't.

445
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:15,091
Guys, look. We got to move
around, get in through the back.

446
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:16,446
These Horsemen are tricky, okay?

447
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,603
They got backup plans
on top of backup plans.

448
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,728
Hey, sorry, don't mean to gloat,
but I told you so.

449
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,006
Cut the bullshit, Rhodes.

450
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,242
We got an anonymous
phone call an hour ago.

451
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:27,004
Confirms everything
I've been telling her.

452
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,081
What are you talking about?

453
00:23:28,160 --> 00:23:29,491
You sent agents
to Detroit and Philadelphia.

454
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,847
You've been crying wolf
so we wouldn't send them here.

455
00:23:31,920 --> 00:23:34,526
- Boss, please.
- Keep working on the doors.

456
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,565
Please tell me that you haven't bought
into Cowan's crazy, paranoid fantasia.

457
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,210
Before we start the show...

458
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:44,001
We had Owen agree to a few terms
and conditions of our own.

459
00:23:44,080 --> 00:23:47,084
So, everything that he had
once considered private...

460
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:51,729
That he thinks is really private...

461
00:23:51,800 --> 00:23:55,771
Yeah, everything that he once
considered private is now...

462
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,205
Oh, my.

463
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:06,001
<i>As the Horsemen like to say,
magic is about controlling perception.</i>

464
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:10,130
<i>You see them as champions of the truth,
but are they?</i>

465
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:13,124
<i>Or is that just another
one of their illusions?</i>

466
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,771
- What's going on, Rhodes?
- This is crazy.

467
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,285
We got to get everyone
to the other exits.

468
00:24:17,360 --> 00:24:19,966
- Let's go, to the back.
- No. You stay here.

469
00:24:20,040 --> 00:24:22,247
<i>So, since they clearly
love secrets...</i>

470
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,846
<i>Let's reveal some of theirs.</i>

471
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,649
Danny, everyone, get off the stage.

472
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:27,926
<i>Abort.</i>

473
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:31,525
Jack, go with them.
I'll see you at the meet-up point.

474
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,601
Let's go.

475
00:24:32,680 --> 00:24:34,808
<i>Do you recall the death of Jack Wilder?</i>

476
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:40,330
<i>What if I told you he's not just alive,
but he's actually right here.</i>

477
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:50,168
<i>And do you know who else is here?
The FBI.</i>

478
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,447
<i>Let's let them in, shall we?</i>

479
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:55,684
<i>And now, for the big reveal.</i>

480
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,411
Go! Go! To the stage.

481
00:24:58,480 --> 00:25:00,562
<i>There's a fifth Horseman,</i>

482
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:03,405
<i>and he's the biggest
criminal of them all.</i>

483
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,126
<i>FBI agent, Dylan Rhodes.</i>

484
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:09,404
- I knew it.
- What?

485
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,530
This is so much deeper
than you know, boss.

486
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,762
You think you're looking at one thing,
but you have no idea.

487
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:17,286
- Who are you?
- The same man I've always been.

488
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:19,203
Boys, I'm sorry.

489
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:29,489
You gotta be kidding me.

490
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:31,608
We've gotta get to the chute. Go!

491
00:25:31,680 --> 00:25:34,445
- Who are those guys?
- Who cares? Come on!

492
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,726
- Hurry, hurry!
- Keep going!

493
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:36,801
How the hell could this happen?

494
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:38,530
I thought Dylan
had everything under control.

495
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,404
Yeah. Apparently he didn't.

496
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,563
Maybe you're the leak, Dan.
Where you been sneaking off to?

497
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,130
Don't you dare for a second
insinuate that I had...

498
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:48,602
- I'm not insinuating. That's your...
- Let's get to the truck, come on!

499
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:50,842
- Stay together!
- Move! Move!

500
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,967
Lula, come on!

501
00:25:52,040 --> 00:25:53,963
Coming! Whoa!

502
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:06,286
<i>Sleep. Sleep. Sleep. Sleep.</i>

503
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,245
What the hell is going on?

504
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,641
- Wasn't there supposed to be a truck?
- Where the hell are we?

505
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:24,120
Come on!

506
00:26:24,200 --> 00:26:26,089
Hey, hey!
Wait, did you mis-run the tube?

507
00:26:26,160 --> 00:26:27,810
No, I put it in the truck.
I know I did!

508
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,450
Because we're really
not in the truck right now.

509
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,851
Somebody must
have moved the tube.

510
00:26:30,920 --> 00:26:32,410
Were we above a Chinese restaurant?
Give me that!

511
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:34,528
- I'm moving! Relax!
- There's something very wrong.

512
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,607
Okay. Why are we here?

513
00:26:39,680 --> 00:26:41,648
Why am I frickin' starving?

514
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:43,848
Yeah, I'm weirdly starving, too.

515
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:46,207
This makes no sense.

516
00:27:10,160 --> 00:27:11,525
Okay, sorry.

517
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:15,167
At least, and I know this
isn't much consolation,

518
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:17,971
but apparently
we're now surrounded by Chinese food.

519
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:20,327
- Right?
- Guys...

520
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:23,961
I think where we are right now, they
don't refer to it as "Chinese food."

521
00:27:24,040 --> 00:27:26,771
It's just called "food."

522
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:33,725
Wait, what are you saying?
How is this possible?

523
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:41,570
I believe in your particular parlance,
the word is "magic."

524
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:44,160
That guy looks exactly like you.

525
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:47,289
He looks exactly like you.
Are you seeing this right now?

526
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,521
Chase.

527
00:27:48,600 --> 00:27:52,571
Must confess, it's like what I heard
about meeting the Rolling Stones.

528
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,563
They're a lot shorter in person.

529
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,484
Remember I told you about the guy
who screwed me out of everything?

530
00:27:57,560 --> 00:28:00,848
This is my twin brother, Chase.

531
00:28:01,000 --> 00:28:02,729
Wait, did you do this?

532
00:28:05,040 --> 00:28:08,840
As you can see,
my boss don't mess around.

533
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:11,605
I do not understand what is
going on right now. At all.

534
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:13,762
Okay, let me break it
down for you.

535
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:17,890
You jumped off a rooftop in New York
and you landed in Macau.

536
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:21,487
AKA the Vegas of China.

537
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,881
And presto-changeo.

538
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,121
Don't you just love it?

539
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:27,282
The "greatest magicians in the world"

540
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:29,840
are the object
of someone else's magic trick?

541
00:28:29,920 --> 00:28:32,082
Isn't that poetic?

542
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:37,764
No? You know what,
I'm not gonna let you guys yuck my yum.

543
00:28:37,840 --> 00:28:40,286
Shoo-shoo. Or mu-shu. Whatever.

544
00:28:41,640 --> 00:28:46,362
Oh, and you know what they say,
"What happens in Macau..."

545
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:49,683
Well, I don't know the rest of it,
'cause it's in Chinese...

546
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,489
Hey, thanks, guys!

547
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:13,571
<i>Reports are coming in
that the infamous Horsemen</i>

548
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:15,608
<i>hijacked the Octa product launch today.</i>

549
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,284
<i>The trick was on them, however,</i>

550
00:29:17,400 --> 00:29:20,722
<i>as we learned of the miraculous
resurrection of Jack Wilder.</i>

551
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,849
<i>And the stunning revelation
that FBI Agent Dylan Rhodes</i>

552
00:29:23,920 --> 00:29:26,366
<i>has been working as a mole
within the Bureau.</i>

553
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:29,808
<i>Questions abound today as an
international manhunt is underway</i>

554
00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,601
<i>for Dylan Rhodes and his elusive
and criminal band of illusionists.</i>

555
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,361
Hey, seriously, where are you guys?

556
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:39,283
I'm at the meetup.
I've been leaving you messages.

557
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,681
I haven't heard from anyone.
Please, call me!

558
00:29:41,800 --> 00:29:42,926
<i>And the stock market</i>

559
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:45,731
<i>saw big gains and modest
losses on Thursday.</i>

560
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:48,764
Hey, tell me you're safe.
Where are you?

561
00:29:48,840 --> 00:29:53,164
Right where you left me,
18 months ago, Agent Rhodes.

562
00:29:53,240 --> 00:29:54,401
Thaddeus?

563
00:29:54,520 --> 00:29:56,363
<i>How does it feel
to lose everything?</i>

564
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:00,405
Your job. Your identity.
Your reason for living.

565
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,609
How does it feel to be out of control,
perhaps for the first time?

566
00:30:06,080 --> 00:30:07,206
What do you want?

567
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,328
You're a fool, Agent Rhodes.
You always have been.

568
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:13,367
- Where are they?
- I'm not telling you on the phone!

569
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:14,441
Where are they?

570
00:30:14,520 --> 00:30:18,525
And if you're wondering if I was behind
the Horsemen's recent debacle,

571
00:30:18,600 --> 00:30:20,364
I'll let you work
that out for yourself.

572
00:30:20,440 --> 00:30:23,444
Hey, I burned you once, I'll burn
you again. I'm not playing, Thaddeus.

573
00:30:23,520 --> 00:30:26,205
It's not my game,
Agent Rhodes. It's yours.

574
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,760
You started it when
you locked me in a cell.

575
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,524
<i>This is simply my move.</i>

576
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:32,608
Next one is yours.

577
00:30:35,920 --> 00:30:37,251
<i>No!</i>

578
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:39,650
Let go!

579
00:30:40,480 --> 00:30:43,927
Dad! Help me! Dad!

580
00:30:45,080 --> 00:30:46,684
<i>Dad!</i>

581
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,043
It's all about blind spots.

582
00:31:06,120 --> 00:31:10,967
When you're staring straight
at something, and not see it. Why?

583
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,404
Blind spots.

584
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:15,721
We learned that together,
didn't we, bro?

585
00:31:15,800 --> 00:31:18,644
Did he tell you that
we were partners once?

586
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:21,883
No? I didn't think so.
The "Mini-McKinneys."

587
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,281
<i>Chasey and a Mer-Bear</i>

588
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,402
<i>Gonna make you scare-bear</i>

589
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:29,802
<i>Ma-ma-magic McKinneys</i>

590
00:31:30,680 --> 00:31:31,886
Cool.

591
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:38,570
And then, one day, we were 12
and Virginia von Welsheim

592
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:41,530
had a very nice party
down the street.

593
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:43,921
I had a little tum-tum, couldn't go.

594
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:49,530
Mer-Bear did it on his own, and got
a taste of the solo thing, and uh...

595
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:54,205
- ...and kicked me to the curb.
- Oh, God.

596
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:58,763
Chase, you win! I concede.
Just tell me how you did it.

597
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:05,007
Delivery guy came to your door
about a month ago, little za.

598
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,161
Za?

599
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:08,208
Pizza, huh?

600
00:32:09,280 --> 00:32:13,604
- Is this apartment d3375?
- Not even close.

601
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:19,205
Sleep!

602
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:22,842
Relaxing, floating,
drifting, dreaming...

603
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,965
Falling.

604
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,611
So, what he did,
my little womb-mate,

605
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:31,605
is he downloaded all
your private information,

606
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:34,883
and my employer
had all he needed.

607
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,325
Thanks.

608
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:39,210
How did you know how to find him?

609
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:42,489
- That's a very good question, Atlas.
- Okay.

610
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,526
Just follow the guards.
They'll take you to my boss.

611
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:10,681
Been fun playing this cat-and-mouse
with you, broski.

612
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,609
Meow.

613
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,770
Have fun at the Sands.

614
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:23,364
- I am so, so, so sorry.
- Yeah, you should be.

615
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,643
Don't ever accuse me
of betraying us again, okay?

616
00:33:39,040 --> 00:33:41,771
Do you guys ever think that
the Eye is watching this?

617
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,320
You know, that maybe this
is even what they want?

618
00:33:46,440 --> 00:33:48,044
And at the exact right moment,

619
00:33:48,120 --> 00:33:50,361
they're gonna swoop in,
and we'll be like,

620
00:33:50,440 --> 00:33:52,283
"Yes! Thank God you're here!

621
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:54,840
Thank God!
Just in the nick of time, Eye!"

622
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:58,925
And then we'll just celebrate,
and it was all worth it in the end?

623
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:05,168
I don't even really
think that, either, so...

624
00:34:05,240 --> 00:34:06,571
It's cool.

625
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,282
So happy to be working with you.

626
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,010
Please, come in. Come in.

627
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,611
Wait, sorry, how are you
working with us?

628
00:34:33,680 --> 00:34:36,604
Oh, well, as much as a magician
who pulls a rabbit from a hat

629
00:34:36,720 --> 00:34:39,530
is working with that rabbit.

630
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:43,161
We'll be working together. Yes.
Allow me to introduce myself.

631
00:34:43,240 --> 00:34:45,766
Yeah, you're Walter Mabry.
You died a year ago.

632
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:47,729
Yes. An idea I got
from you, Mr. Wilder.

633
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:49,723
Fake your death,
the world puts its guard down.

634
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,802
I'm able to control
quite a few companies,

635
00:34:51,880 --> 00:34:53,405
including my old partner, Owen's,

636
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:56,609
as a consortium of so-called
anonymous shareholders.

637
00:34:56,680 --> 00:35:00,401
- And that violates how many SEC laws?
- I believe it breaks all of them.

638
00:35:00,480 --> 00:35:01,845
All of them.

639
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,810
You see, you all want an audience.

640
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:08,327
Need one, desperately.
It's quite sad, really.

641
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:10,482
Hence, my ability to nab you.

642
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:13,370
I, on the other hand,
want the opposite of that.

643
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:17,843
I just want to be, and I am
100 percent off the grid.

644
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,206
You know why?

645
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:21,806
Yeah, because the grid
is for actual human beings.

646
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:24,201
No, because in a world
of total surveillance,

647
00:35:24,280 --> 00:35:27,409
the only true freedom
lies in not being seen.

648
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,761
You can't control the grid
from within the grid.

649
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,729
- Follow me.
- Yeah.

650
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:33,609
- Follow me.
- Okay. All right.

651
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:35,967
You pulled a hat out of a rabbit.
That was very colorful.

652
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:39,567
Almost eight and a half years ago.
So, no need to bring that up.

653
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:42,291
We can't all be held accountable
for our adolescent personas.

654
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:44,488
Can we, Magicolio?

655
00:35:44,560 --> 00:35:46,881
Magicolio, that was 15 years ago.

656
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:48,849
Don't get me wrong, I love magic.

657
00:35:48,920 --> 00:35:50,126
Like you, and many others who,

658
00:35:50,200 --> 00:35:53,249
I suppose, were not getting any sex
in high school, I dabbled with it.

659
00:35:53,320 --> 00:35:58,690
But, unlike you, I was able to
transition upward towards actual magic.

660
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:00,928
Science, you may
have heard it called.

661
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:07,809
So, would you like to know,
my friends, just how I got you here?

662
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,211
We know how you did it.

663
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:10,281
No, you don't.

664
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:13,091
Yeah, you stole our files for the show,
then obviously hypnotized us.

665
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:14,605
Stop. No. Seriously, stop.

666
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:17,001
The strobe was a combo
of binaural beats, as well as--

667
00:36:17,080 --> 00:36:19,447
I said stop!

668
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:22,000
You might not be having fun,
but I am.

669
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,246
You have an unusual way of showing it.

670
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:26,881
So...

671
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,523
How did I do it?

672
00:36:29,600 --> 00:36:34,162
Easy. You see, magicians like to control
other people's perceptions.

673
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:35,526
In your heightened state of agitation,

674
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:37,967
<i>you saw the simplest cues.
Black tube, roof.</i>

675
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:40,441
<i>And your minds filled in the rest.</i>

676
00:36:40,520 --> 00:36:43,364
<i>But the tube you meant to go down
was 20 feet to your right.</i>

677
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:45,442
Go on, sit down. There's no one
standing in your way.

678
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:47,010
Don't mind if I do.

679
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:51,042
Anyway, once in the tube,
yes, you're right...

680
00:36:51,120 --> 00:36:54,920
<i>Blah, blah, blah, the strobe contained
UV letters pulsing the word "sleep."</i>

681
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,800
<i>And that, combined with the sound,
put you into an instant alpha pattern.</i>

682
00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:03,690
<i>Sleep, sleep, sleep.</i>

683
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:05,444
And from then on,
it really was just fun.

684
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:08,569
And I can assure you,
you don't know what happened.

685
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:16,604
That's really creepy.
Really, really creepy.

686
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,691
That's not cool.

687
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,928
Yep, easy stuff, magic,

688
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,051
if you put your mind to it.

689
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,088
All right, that's enough.
So why are we here, then?

690
00:37:27,160 --> 00:37:29,891
Besides you getting to show off
how adorably clever you are.

691
00:37:29,960 --> 00:37:32,770
Well, to start with,
the man you stole from last year,

692
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:35,605
turns out I had invested quite a lot
of money in some of his companies,

693
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:38,889
so a lot of what you
stole was, in fact, mine.

694
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:41,725
Good news is, it's very easy for you
to pay me back.

695
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,531
I just need your skills.

696
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:47,490
Owen and I were like the Beatles,
if the Beatles had been...

697
00:37:47,560 --> 00:37:48,607
Elfin?

698
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:50,011
...geniuses.

699
00:37:50,120 --> 00:37:51,724
Pretty sure the Beatles were geniuses.

700
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:54,121
And like them, we had a dream.

701
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:58,686
Could we create actual, genuine magic?

702
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:02,162
And I'm guessing one of you achieved
that dream, and it wasn't you?

703
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:05,369
That is what he
would like you to think.

704
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:10,526
My vision was a perfect blend
of elegance and technology.

705
00:38:10,640 --> 00:38:12,961
But Owen wanted it for himself
so he humiliated me

706
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:16,203
by exposing my private files
to the board of directors

707
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:17,725
and convinced them
that I am unstable.

708
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,962
Did you take a picture of him
while he was sleeping?

709
00:38:20,040 --> 00:38:21,405
He had me kicked out of
my own company,

710
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:23,847
and now he goes around
taking credit for a chip

711
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:25,684
that's not just the key to one computer,

712
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,764
but every computer
system on the planet.

713
00:38:28,840 --> 00:38:31,923
It can un-encrypt anything,
crack the defense firewall,

714
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,765
manipulate markets,
and spy on anyone.

715
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:36,604
And now it's being sold
to the highest bidder.

716
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,330
If you're so rich,
why don't you just buy it?

717
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,811
So he gets the money?

718
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:42,082
And the pleasure? No.

719
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:45,403
No, no, no. Besides, why would I buy it
when I could have you steal it for me?

720
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,641
Oh!

721
00:38:46,760 --> 00:38:48,683
It's being previewed tomorrow
to the various suitors,

722
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:52,401
which will include your targets,
a crew lead by a South African gangster.

723
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:53,970
South African gangster.

724
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,769
Yes. How your team
gets past security, that's up to you.

725
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:59,083
But once you do, you just need
to inspect it and steal it.

726
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:00,161
That's it?

727
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,049
Come on, this is
perfect for you, isn't it?

728
00:39:02,120 --> 00:39:03,201
You're magicians and thieves.

729
00:39:03,280 --> 00:39:05,886
What makes you think we would even
consider doing this?

730
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:09,328
Oh, wait, I had a reason.
What was it? Oh, yes.

731
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:10,970
You see, back home,
you're wanted criminals.

732
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:14,328
But here, I control the police,
the casinos, the media.

733
00:39:14,400 --> 00:39:17,609
I can give you a new life,
out of hiding.

734
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,086
And if you don't,
I'll have you killed.

735
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,726
You know what?
I'm not stealing a thing for you.

736
00:39:25,840 --> 00:39:29,925
- Not unless Dylan tells me it's okay.
- Really? Dylan is where, exactly?

737
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,890
It doesn't matter. Yeah, I'm with him.
So you can go ahead and kill us

738
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,962
because I'm not gonna
steal anything for you either.

739
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:38,647
Strikes me that a consensus
seems to be forming, Walter,

740
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,245
and we're calling your bluff.

741
00:39:41,960 --> 00:39:44,008
- Actually, we'll do it.
- What?

742
00:39:44,080 --> 00:39:46,845
We're in Macau. The oldest
magic store in the world is here.

743
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:50,288
We'll get the supplies
we need, and we'll do it.

744
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:52,809
Thank you.

745
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:54,370
It should be fun.

746
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:57,444
Chase will take you
to the magic shop in the morning.

747
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:03,561
Badge.

748
00:40:07,120 --> 00:40:08,451
Really?

749
00:40:10,560 --> 00:40:11,971
Thanks.

750
00:40:12,040 --> 00:40:16,489
Agent Cowan. Your ID.

751
00:40:16,600 --> 00:40:18,011
Oh, yeah. Thanks.

752
00:40:22,080 --> 00:40:24,560
It appears Mr. Bradley's
still at dinner.

753
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:27,371
Yeah? Tell him recess is over.

754
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:36,281
What?

755
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:55,805
All right, so I made my move.

756
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:58,042
Where are they?
I don't have time for bullshit.

757
00:40:58,120 --> 00:41:00,646
Oh, I have all the time
in the world, thanks to you.

758
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,122
And I didn't get to finish my lobster,
which makes me very grumpy.

759
00:41:04,200 --> 00:41:06,965
Okay, let's cut the crap.
What do you want?

760
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,203
You can dispense with
the tough guy act to begin with.

761
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,846
You're too desperate
for it to be believable.

762
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:17,566
I said, what do you want?

763
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:21,247
You used a form 219 warrant
to search my room.

764
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:24,005
You found a connection
between me and the Four Horsemen.

765
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:29,211
Which means you can take me
out of here on a 24-hour leave.

766
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:33,490
- You want me to break you out?
- I want you to take me out.

767
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:36,131
All you need is an extradition order,

768
00:41:36,200 --> 00:41:38,931
which you'll find in
that tray by my printer.

769
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:45,170
Dylan, I had nothing to do
with the Horsemen's disappearance.

770
00:41:45,240 --> 00:41:47,720
You were lured into a trap.

771
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:50,849
And like Dorothy did
when she landed in Oz,

772
00:41:50,920 --> 00:41:57,166
you're beginning to realize
that the only way out is through.

773
00:41:57,240 --> 00:42:00,244
And I'm the only one
who can get you there.

774
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,525
You got this place wired.

775
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:06,730
You don't need me to get out of here.
This is all about payback.

776
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:10,600
- I believe in an eye for an eye.
- So you're out to destroy me?

777
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:11,886
Oh, absolutely.

778
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,200
You think I'm still gonna
play your little game?

779
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,964
I know you will.

780
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:19,045
Because no matter how hard you try
to find a culprit behind all this,

781
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,487
you're going to blame only yourself.

782
00:42:21,600 --> 00:42:26,049
When your little vendetta ended with you
putting me in jail 18 months ago,

783
00:42:26,120 --> 00:42:30,011
you got tired, you got sloppy.
You stopped paying attention.

784
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,128
And that's where you lost.

785
00:42:35,320 --> 00:42:38,802
So, you can save yourself,

786
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:45,043
or you can make a deal with me,
and save the Four Horsemen,

787
00:42:45,120 --> 00:42:48,408
and stop wasting both of our time.

788
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:56,010
Steal something for this narcissistic
little man boy? I don't like it.

789
00:42:56,080 --> 00:42:58,208
But what I like less
is you deciding for us.

790
00:42:58,280 --> 00:43:00,851
Yeah? Do you like that we're the
laughing stocks of the magic world,

791
00:43:00,920 --> 00:43:02,763
and the fugitives
of the actual world?

792
00:43:02,840 --> 00:43:04,569
Walter is right.
We have nowhere to go.

793
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,880
But we can fix that.

794
00:43:05,960 --> 00:43:07,166
- We can fix it?
- Yeah.

795
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:08,765
So you're officially
part of the team now?

796
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,649
- Excuse me?
- I'm sure this is what Dylan

797
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,802
meant when he said we should
all work as a single organism.

798
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,123
Yeah, that is a fairytale
that Dylan tells himself, and tells us.

799
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,851
Look, even if we get this stick,
he'll never let us go.

800
00:43:18,920 --> 00:43:23,005
We can't trust Walter, okay?
The Eye has a history in Macau.

801
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:24,451
They're the only ones we can trust.

802
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:25,521
Now, if we can get it to them,

803
00:43:25,600 --> 00:43:27,887
they can clear our names
and get us the hell out of here.

804
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,490
It's a bad plan, man.

805
00:43:37,160 --> 00:43:38,161
Hey.

806
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:40,446
Hi, how are you?

807
00:43:40,520 --> 00:43:42,488
We need some things custom-made.

808
00:43:42,560 --> 00:43:44,164
Actually, by tomorrow.
We're kind of in a rush.

809
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:45,924
And...

810
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:48,207
You have no idea what
I'm talking about, do you?

811
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:57,448
Welcome to long's.
My name's Li. Not Bruce Lee.

812
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:58,760
- What?
- Got you.

813
00:43:58,840 --> 00:43:59,887
- Okay.
- Look.

814
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:02,921
Where'd it go?

815
00:44:05,560 --> 00:44:07,369
Oh! And now it's by my head. How fun.

816
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,010
- $20.
- $20?

817
00:44:09,080 --> 00:44:10,969
No, thank you.
We're kind of in a rush.

818
00:44:11,040 --> 00:44:13,281
- $10.
- No.

819
00:44:13,360 --> 00:44:14,646
- Two for one.
- No.

820
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:16,290
Okay, all right.
Just give us the thumbs. Yeah?

821
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,601
Okay. Thanks a lot, Jack.
Please take these.

822
00:44:18,680 --> 00:44:21,331
So, we need a Keplinger holdout,

823
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:25,405
and we also need roughing fluid,
a Sanada gimmick, sleeves, tracks.

824
00:44:25,480 --> 00:44:27,403
This is all in plastic,
though, if you can.

825
00:44:32,000 --> 00:44:33,001
What?

826
00:44:35,240 --> 00:44:36,765
Is there a problem?

827
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:40,003
My grandmother wants to know
why plastic? Plastic is cheap.

828
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:42,367
Sorry. Yeah, we need plastic
because we're...

829
00:44:42,440 --> 00:44:46,001
We're going through a very sensitive
metal detector, okay?

830
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:48,805
So plastic, nothing. Metal...

831
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:52,081
It detects.

832
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:58,527
What did she say?

833
00:44:58,600 --> 00:45:01,968
She said just because you're
talking slowly and moving your hands

834
00:45:02,040 --> 00:45:04,042
doesn't mean she can suddenly
understand English.

835
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:06,885
Oh, yeah. So sorry. He's racist.

836
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:11,170
Hey, bro. Listen, I know
that the only thing that we agree on

837
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:13,846
is that our mom and dad
had one too many children.

838
00:45:13,920 --> 00:45:18,209
So why don't we just let
the kids play with their toys

839
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:19,770
and go get a little drinkey-poo?

840
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:25,210
- If it's free, it's me.
- Great. Guys, we'll be right back.

841
00:45:25,280 --> 00:45:28,887
Okay, kiddies,
the chaperones are watching you.

842
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,247
Don't do anything I wouldn't enjoy.

843
00:45:32,320 --> 00:45:34,368
Okay. Have fun, you two.

844
00:45:36,720 --> 00:45:40,167
Hey. Can I use your phone?
It's kind of important.

845
00:45:40,240 --> 00:45:41,605
Sure.

846
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:44,090
- On the house.
- Thanks.

847
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:46,841
Who are you calling?

848
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:48,365
I'm arranging
to hand over the stick.

849
00:45:48,440 --> 00:45:50,204
So that's how we've been
contacting the Eye?

850
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,566
You've been doing it
on your own?

851
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:52,766
Maybe.

852
00:45:52,840 --> 00:45:55,241
Oh, God.
Dylan's not gonna like this.

853
00:45:55,320 --> 00:45:57,402
I'm not really concerned
with what Dylan likes. Okay?

854
00:45:57,480 --> 00:45:58,720
I'm doing this for us.

855
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,646
- What is wrong with this thing?
- Hey, relax, it's just a kid's toy.

856
00:46:04,720 --> 00:46:06,051
Yeah, that's what I thought.

857
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:07,485
Okay. Let me just...

858
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:09,927
Sorry, sorry. Jesus.

859
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:14,406
Hey, can you get this?

860
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:20,968
It's like birth, you know.

861
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:24,487
One person enters the hospital,
two people come out.

862
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:26,005
Walk and talk.

863
00:46:26,080 --> 00:46:28,401
I'll tell you on the plane.

864
00:46:28,480 --> 00:46:30,608
What plane?

865
00:46:30,680 --> 00:46:33,650
My sources tell me
your Horsemen are in Macau.

866
00:46:34,400 --> 00:46:36,687
- What's the look?
- It's none of your business.

867
00:46:36,760 --> 00:46:37,966
Who are your sources?

868
00:46:40,640 --> 00:46:42,722
Just some old friends.

869
00:46:49,560 --> 00:46:52,643
When we have the card, where do I go?

870
00:46:52,720 --> 00:46:54,802
And 0 for 52.

871
00:46:55,120 --> 00:46:58,169
Well, it's perfect.
It's a perfect score.

872
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:02,084
Then what about girls?

873
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:04,003
Like, relationships?

874
00:47:04,080 --> 00:47:05,206
What?

875
00:47:09,080 --> 00:47:12,641
Look, it's not
something I'm proud of,

876
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:18,762
but every girl I get close to,
I end up taking their trust.

877
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:21,320
And then their wallet.

878
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,046
So...

879
00:47:25,520 --> 00:47:28,046
- You take their wallets?
- Yeah.

880
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,408
You ever take their belts?

881
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:38,289
Or how about some peanuts
from the hotel bar?

882
00:47:38,360 --> 00:47:41,330
Not sure why you took those.

883
00:47:41,400 --> 00:47:44,483
I'm sorry, did you think
that I was like those other girls?

884
00:47:46,040 --> 00:47:47,849
Oh, Jack.

885
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:55,767
Okay. So there's a marketplace
down the street.

886
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:57,968
And I'm meeting
a man with a blue hat.

887
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:00,771
He'll get the stick to the right people
and get us home.

888
00:48:00,840 --> 00:48:02,888
You go grab Merritt, okay?
We got a lot to do.

889
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,689
And, hey, put your belt on.

890
00:48:04,760 --> 00:48:07,445
Oh, no, it's not...
She took it off me and...

891
00:48:08,680 --> 00:48:11,524
You know, the most
heartbreaking moment of my life

892
00:48:11,600 --> 00:48:16,322
was when I discovered that you had
stolen all my money and split.

893
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,482
I didn't realize until now

894
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:21,040
how much of that money
you put into your face.

895
00:48:21,120 --> 00:48:25,682
Seriously, is it weird to have more hair
in your nose than on your head?

896
00:48:25,760 --> 00:48:28,331
Speaking of, next time
you get a hair transplant,

897
00:48:28,400 --> 00:48:34,043
you might wanna consider requesting
something other than old man pubes.

898
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:38,170
You know what?
You are such a buffoon, Mer-Bear.

899
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,163
And this little ploy you have

900
00:48:40,240 --> 00:48:44,325
of stalling me while your friends
screw over my employer?

901
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:46,044
Not gonna work.

902
00:48:48,440 --> 00:48:52,650
Chase! As you stare into my eyes,
you will find that you wanna sleep.

903
00:48:52,720 --> 00:48:55,371
When you wake, you will beg
for Merritt's forgiveness

904
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,603
and realize that you will never be
half the man that he is.

905
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:07,330
Merritt, I am so,
so very, very sorry

906
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:10,131
about how pathetic your pupil is.

907
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:13,363
Hey, a little hint
on your technique of surprise.

908
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:17,764
It lacks that all-essential
little element of surprise.

909
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:22,649
Hey, this has been fun, Mer-Bear.
Let's do it again sometime.

910
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:31,007
Well, I've had ample time
to do some research, and you know,

911
00:49:31,080 --> 00:49:32,127
I was wrong.

912
00:49:32,200 --> 00:49:35,807
I think the Eye
might actually be real.

913
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:37,370
Thought you didn't
buy into all that.

914
00:49:37,440 --> 00:49:39,442
I'd be lying if I
said I didn't think

915
00:49:39,520 --> 00:49:42,842
that this road would lead to
the great wizard behind the curtain

916
00:49:42,920 --> 00:49:45,491
and, in the end,
I might get to see his face.

917
00:49:45,560 --> 00:49:46,766
That ain't gonna happen.

918
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:48,410
Even if the fate of
the Horsemen depends on it?

919
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,165
Listen to me. I broke you out of there.
We're not changing the terms now.

920
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:53,971
- You put me there!
- Yeah, because you deserve to be there.

921
00:49:54,040 --> 00:49:57,567
- Listen, I did not kill your father.
- What?

922
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:00,604
All right, all right,
let's just cut the bullshit.

923
00:50:00,680 --> 00:50:04,241
I know who you are, Shrike.

924
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:07,602
I know you blame me
for your father's death.

925
00:50:07,680 --> 00:50:11,651
I know you think I goaded him into
performing a trick he couldn't pull off.

926
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:16,567
I know the time in jail was a result
of a 30-year revenge plot against me.

927
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:18,847
Supposing that's all true,
you think I'd tell you now?

928
00:50:18,920 --> 00:50:20,126
Man...

929
00:50:21,840 --> 00:50:23,490
Thirty years.

930
00:50:23,560 --> 00:50:29,169
Thirty years, and the greatest long game
magic trick ever created.

931
00:50:29,240 --> 00:50:33,040
Just to put me behind bars. Okay.

932
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,489
So how did it feel, seeing me there?

933
00:50:37,520 --> 00:50:39,284
Was it all you hoped?

934
00:50:39,360 --> 00:50:40,805
I don't know what you're talking about.

935
00:50:40,880 --> 00:50:44,965
You're lying.
It was an empty experience.

936
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:47,088
And you wanna know how I know?

937
00:50:48,160 --> 00:50:50,891
I know because you know.

938
00:50:52,200 --> 00:50:56,808
There's always, always more
than what's on the surface.

939
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,281
So what, the past didn't happen,
and you're not who I think you are?

940
00:50:59,360 --> 00:51:00,486
Now, don't tell me in 30 years

941
00:51:00,560 --> 00:51:03,404
that's the first time you've
asked yourself that question.

942
00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:07,402
I am not my father.
You're not getting in my head, okay?

943
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:10,006
You think you're luring me into a trap?
You're not.

944
00:51:10,080 --> 00:51:12,686
Now, I am desperate,
which means I'm dangerous.

945
00:51:12,760 --> 00:51:16,242
My only concern is the health
and well-being of the Horsemen.

946
00:51:16,320 --> 00:51:19,802
And you're gonna lead me to them.
And if you don't, I promise you,

947
00:51:19,880 --> 00:51:23,771
you're gonna end up far worse
than in some cushy jail cell somewhere.

948
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:40,767
What if the Horsemen
don't actually need you to save them?

949
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:48,130
All right. So the lab
is made up of two distinct layers,

950
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:51,249
the security perimeter
and the clean room.

951
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,322
The stick we're looking for
should be in this core.

952
00:51:53,400 --> 00:51:55,448
So we're gonna have to
get underneath, extract it,

953
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,249
and replace it with a decoy.

954
00:51:57,320 --> 00:51:58,651
Now, we're about to get to the chip.

955
00:51:58,760 --> 00:52:00,330
This is the thing
about the chip, it's very thin.

956
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:03,290
Luckily, it's similar
in weight and size to a playing card,

957
00:52:03,360 --> 00:52:05,249
so we're gonna have to
brush up on our card-istry.

958
00:52:12,800 --> 00:52:13,961
That's no good.

959
00:52:23,480 --> 00:52:25,687
So how do we get in? Hannes Pike.

960
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:27,569
He's the son of
a South African gangster.

961
00:52:27,640 --> 00:52:29,324
<i>He's RSVP'd with what looks like</i>

962
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,368
<i>a couple of members
of his security detail.</i>

963
00:52:31,440 --> 00:52:34,444
<i>A doctor, to vet it, I guess,
and somebody named Buffy.</i>

964
00:52:34,520 --> 00:52:38,206
<i>Yeah, apparently, he travels
with a different bimbo every week. Hmm.</i>

965
00:52:38,280 --> 00:52:40,931
I wonder which one of us
gets to play the bimbo.

966
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,363
Hey, can I get in?

967
00:52:53,080 --> 00:52:54,650
At the soothing sound of the slots

968
00:52:54,720 --> 00:52:58,088
you slip into a serene state
of slumber and sleep.

969
00:52:59,600 --> 00:53:01,125
<i>Jack, for a moment,</i>

970
00:53:01,240 --> 00:53:03,925
<i>they will think you're Hannes,
so lead them out and keep them busy.</i>

971
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,207
You trust your people implicitly.

972
00:53:06,280 --> 00:53:08,328
You will have them
take care of everything,

973
00:53:08,400 --> 00:53:09,811
and you will wait in the car.

974
00:53:09,880 --> 00:53:13,441
And eyes open, wide awake. Go.

975
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,329
Excuse me.
These people are following me.

976
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,640
You might wanna
check their pockets.

977
00:53:20,720 --> 00:53:23,041
<i>Then our time is
ticking to infiltrate the lab</i>

978
00:53:23,120 --> 00:53:25,202
<i>and get the card to the market,
where I'll hand it off to the Eye,</i>

979
00:53:25,280 --> 00:53:26,805
<i>so we can all get the hell home.</i>

980
00:53:45,840 --> 00:53:49,128
Hannes, my old friend.
So glad you could make it.

981
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:52,283
I knew you had a soft spot
for an old-school bidding war.

982
00:53:52,360 --> 00:53:53,441
How have you been?

983
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:57,161
I trust my people implicitly.
What they say goes.

984
00:53:57,240 --> 00:54:00,323
Certainly. But I'm sure
you'd like to see it for yourself.

985
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:03,210
Hold it in your hands,
check the build quality.

986
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:08,206
Or not. Also fine.

987
00:54:08,280 --> 00:54:10,282
Well, if you'd like to follow me.

988
00:54:13,800 --> 00:54:18,203
You'll have to remove all your metal.
Watches, rings, etc.

989
00:54:18,280 --> 00:54:20,647
- Yeah, of course.
- Excuse me for asking...

990
00:54:20,720 --> 00:54:22,563
Where might I have seen you before?

991
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:26,326
I don't know, probably
one of my many symposiums.

992
00:54:26,400 --> 00:54:27,481
The book jacket!

993
00:54:27,560 --> 00:54:30,404
I have to say, Dr. Michaelakis,
I'm a huge fan.

994
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:32,323
Oh, thank you so much.

995
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,880
Which book?
There have been so many...

996
00:54:36,040 --> 00:54:38,771
Does Hannes' chippy
always talk for you, Doctor?

997
00:54:40,600 --> 00:54:41,601
Doctor?

998
00:54:44,360 --> 00:54:48,081
Sorry, when you say "chippy,"
you are referring to Buffy here, yeah?

999
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:49,321
Of course.

1000
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:55,649
Hannes prefers the term "floozy"
for all his boy toys.

1001
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:58,769
- Yeah. He does. That's good.
- Noted.

1002
00:54:58,840 --> 00:55:00,888
By the way,
I got your email, Dr. Michaelakis.

1003
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:02,485
You had a query about our ability

1004
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,642
to maintain quantum coherence
at room temperature

1005
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:09,282
without the use of dilution,
refrigerators, or error correction.

1006
00:55:09,360 --> 00:55:10,964
Do you care to elucidate?

1007
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:12,405
- Right.
- Yeah.

1008
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,448
Yes, I did send that email.

1009
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:17,490
- The other day, I saw you.
- I did, I sent it. So what gives?

1010
00:55:17,560 --> 00:55:19,005
I'm sorry, what gives...

1011
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:20,605
I think what she's trying to say...

1012
00:55:20,680 --> 00:55:22,648
Actually, the grown-ups
are having a meeting, Buffy.

1013
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:24,006
Okay.

1014
00:55:24,080 --> 00:55:25,320
If you'll hold on to that.

1015
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,129
- Yeah, sure, Doctor.
- Thank you.

1016
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:29,680
Now, every seventh grader,
even the dumb ones,

1017
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:31,808
know the second law
of thermodynamics.

1018
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:35,601
"All ordered systems
tend toward disorder." Disorder!

1019
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:40,288
So I'm going to ask you one
more time, sir, what gives?

1020
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:49,123
Well, it's actually
topological quantum order.

1021
00:55:49,240 --> 00:55:52,289
The emergence of quantum effects
on a macroscopic level.

1022
00:55:52,360 --> 00:55:55,250
So that is, in fact, what gives.

1023
00:56:00,280 --> 00:56:01,361
Thank you.

1024
00:56:07,920 --> 00:56:11,970
You know,
Buffy is not a bad name for you.

1025
00:56:12,040 --> 00:56:15,647
You know, buff, firm, taut.

1026
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:17,484
That's good.
Did you just find a thesaurus somewhere?

1027
00:56:17,600 --> 00:56:18,886
Nubile.

1028
00:56:18,960 --> 00:56:22,089
- That's good. Thank you. Okay.
- There we go.

1029
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:34,084
Sorry, sorry.

1030
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:43,401
The stick's metal.
How are we going to get it out?

1031
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:44,686
Yeah. I don't know.

1032
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:47,684
This is the housing.

1033
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:52,322
820 million qubit miles
of digi-synaptic resonance.

1034
00:56:57,720 --> 00:57:00,121
But of course, what sets us apart
from anything else on the planet

1035
00:57:00,200 --> 00:57:04,922
is the processor, which we playfully
refer to as the Magic Broomstick.

1036
00:57:05,000 --> 00:57:06,001
The Broomstick?

1037
00:57:06,080 --> 00:57:09,801
Has the power to clear the contents
of any computing system on the planet

1038
00:57:09,880 --> 00:57:12,531
and then magically
sweep them into your bin.

1039
00:57:12,600 --> 00:57:15,251
Oh! Broomstick. That's funny.

1040
00:57:15,320 --> 00:57:18,085
Take a look, vet it however you'd like,

1041
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,481
and tell Hannes we'll be
taking bids on Monday.

1042
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:21,766
Thank you.

1043
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:26,525
Oh, my God.
I must be allergic to something in here.

1044
00:57:26,600 --> 00:57:28,523
What could you possibly be
allergic to in here?

1045
00:57:28,600 --> 00:57:31,809
- This room is hermetically sealed.
- That's it.

1046
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:33,723
I'm allergic to hermetic seals.

1047
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:35,484
If we could get him away
from the computer, please.

1048
00:57:35,560 --> 00:57:38,245
- That's the one thing.
- Just until he's recovered.

1049
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:39,890
We're gonna need some anti-bac...

1050
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,804
Do we have alcohol wipes?

1051
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:45,201
Your hands need to be sterile
if you intend to get any closer.

1052
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,487
Do I make myself clear?

1053
00:57:49,160 --> 00:57:51,970
- Sorry. We couldn't...
- No, I'm fine.

1054
00:57:52,040 --> 00:57:53,280
...take his medicine into the country.

1055
00:57:53,360 --> 00:57:54,521
Yeah...

1056
00:57:57,920 --> 00:58:00,366
Can't risk any contamination.

1057
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:03,205
You're gonna have to stay away
from the inner workings.

1058
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:04,645
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

1059
00:58:04,720 --> 00:58:06,324
- All right. If you're done...
- Oh. Here you go.

1060
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:08,129
Sorry about this.
Okay. I'm okay.

1061
00:58:08,200 --> 00:58:10,328
This happens to him sometimes.
It'll pass.

1062
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,289
Allergies. Nothing you can do.

1063
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:14,362
Well, something you could do, Doctor.

1064
00:58:34,440 --> 00:58:35,726
Okay?

1065
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:43,481
Search him, please.

1066
00:58:43,560 --> 00:58:45,005
Didn't we just do that?

1067
00:58:45,080 --> 00:58:46,411
Are you serious?

1068
00:58:46,480 --> 00:58:48,448
Okay. I wanna run
full diagnostics on the system.

1069
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,249
This is completely unnecessary.

1070
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:23,006
Up, up.

1071
00:59:23,120 --> 00:59:24,246
Okay.

1072
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,801
Hey! I can walk on my own.

1073
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:58,641
Sorry.

1074
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:17,481
Hey!

1075
01:00:17,560 --> 01:00:19,449
I can do that myself.

1076
01:00:19,520 --> 01:00:21,807
We just met, man.

1077
01:00:21,880 --> 01:00:23,245
Handsy, handsy, handsy.

1078
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:36,481
Hey!

1079
01:00:37,640 --> 01:00:40,120
My eyes are up here, man.

1080
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:41,651
How do you like it?

1081
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:05,281
Hey, I'm good.

1082
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:08,001
Turn around.

1083
01:01:26,160 --> 01:01:27,400
Do you have anything?

1084
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:29,164
I don't know.
Can't trust anybody.

1085
01:01:30,640 --> 01:01:32,881
- I'm good.
- They're clean.

1086
01:01:34,360 --> 01:01:36,283
Do your final checks
and get them out of here.

1087
01:01:36,360 --> 01:01:38,681
Oh, we're walking
this way again. Yay.

1088
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:47,807
I don't speak the language.

1089
01:01:54,200 --> 01:01:55,611
See?

1090
01:01:55,680 --> 01:01:57,489
What did I tell you, man?
We didn't have anything.

1091
01:01:58,560 --> 01:02:01,086
Thanks, pal. Appreciate that.

1092
01:02:17,040 --> 01:02:20,761
Something about a big white dance floor,
makes me wanna boogie.

1093
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:23,121
Hey, thanks for having us.

1094
01:02:23,680 --> 01:02:25,603
That's great stuff.

1095
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:32,960
Okay.

1096
01:02:33,040 --> 01:02:35,520
You guys are pretty serious
about your security, huh?

1097
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,564
Okay.

1098
01:02:40,640 --> 01:02:44,087
Do I have all my things?
I feel like I came in with more stuff.

1099
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:46,811
Did I come in with more stuff?

1100
01:02:46,880 --> 01:02:49,042
You don't think so?

1101
01:02:51,240 --> 01:02:53,766
Sir, I think you still have my wallet.

1102
01:02:53,840 --> 01:02:56,491
Remember, I, uh, gave it
to you when I came in?

1103
01:02:56,560 --> 01:02:58,722
It would be nice to leave with it.

1104
01:03:03,560 --> 01:03:04,561
Wallet coming through.

1105
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:14,044
Sorry, my belt.

1106
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:23,368
I guess that's everything, right?

1107
01:03:23,440 --> 01:03:24,521
Thank you.

1108
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:27,126
- That is not a toy, Buffy.
- Sorry.

1109
01:03:32,360 --> 01:03:33,930
Go, go, go!

1110
01:03:40,480 --> 01:03:42,323
All right.
Drop me off at the market

1111
01:03:42,400 --> 01:03:44,164
so I can get this to the Eye.

1112
01:03:44,240 --> 01:03:45,446
You asked me to call you
when they started

1113
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:47,602
running around like headless chickens.

1114
01:03:48,640 --> 01:03:50,051
Well, that's what's happening.

1115
01:04:04,840 --> 01:04:07,491
This is where your sources
told you they'd be?

1116
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:11,360
No, this is where my sources said
we might find an answer.

1117
01:04:22,520 --> 01:04:24,284
She must be familiar with your work.

1118
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:25,771
Excuse me.

1119
01:04:25,880 --> 01:04:29,043
Miss, have you seen these people?

1120
01:04:39,760 --> 01:04:42,127
She says her grandson
spoke to their leader.

1121
01:04:42,200 --> 01:04:43,406
He's in the back.

1122
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:45,246
What?

1123
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:47,203
No "Wow, you speak Mandarin"?

1124
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:21,042
The Coffin to the Beyond.

1125
01:05:22,520 --> 01:05:27,048
It was always a flap,
or a trap or mirrors.

1126
01:05:28,280 --> 01:05:31,682
The audience thought
he'd just disappeared.

1127
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:35,644
But he was always
hidden somewhere inside.

1128
01:05:47,320 --> 01:05:52,042
I believe that's the prototype
for the one your father had made.

1129
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:55,442
He, like many others over the years,
ordered his supplies from here.

1130
01:05:57,640 --> 01:05:59,369
Of course.

1131
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:03,161
That's why you gave me the look
when I said they were in Macau.

1132
01:06:03,240 --> 01:06:05,447
Your father used to come here
when you were young.

1133
01:06:05,520 --> 01:06:07,249
Can I please get some space here?

1134
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:16,530
If you think you're the only one who'd
wondered for 30 years what happened...

1135
01:06:16,960 --> 01:06:18,610
...you're not.

1136
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:21,001
Lionel was a master magician.

1137
01:06:21,120 --> 01:06:22,610
Either he gamed the hinges,

1138
01:06:22,680 --> 01:06:26,207
so he could kick the door
and they would pop out,

1139
01:06:26,280 --> 01:06:30,126
or he had access to the lock
from the inside so he could pick it.

1140
01:06:30,200 --> 01:06:34,888
Word is the safe was made
from cheap metal, and it bowed.

1141
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:40,603
Still, he always had
something up his sleeve.

1142
01:06:40,680 --> 01:06:47,290
Unless he'd reached the limit of
his capabilities and his clock ran out.

1143
01:06:52,080 --> 01:06:56,608
Excuse me. My grandmother
has something you might want.

1144
01:07:00,360 --> 01:07:02,601
This was your father's.

1145
01:07:02,680 --> 01:07:04,887
He had several of these made.

1146
01:07:24,280 --> 01:07:25,930
And the Horsemen?

1147
01:07:26,840 --> 01:07:28,968
I overheard them talking.

1148
01:07:29,040 --> 01:07:33,523
One of them, Atlas, he's meeting
someone at the market nearby.

1149
01:07:50,760 --> 01:07:52,364
As for former Agent Rhodes,

1150
01:07:52,440 --> 01:07:55,046
his location is now
your number one priority.

1151
01:07:55,120 --> 01:07:57,282
We're putting out an international APB.

1152
01:07:57,360 --> 01:08:00,125
We have Interpol, including cooperation
from local authorities.

1153
01:08:00,200 --> 01:08:01,440
Agent Cowan.

1154
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:05,127
I'm assuming it was actually not you
who walked into Newburgh Federal Prison,

1155
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:08,124
then walked out 30 minutes later
with Thaddeus Bradley?

1156
01:08:08,200 --> 01:08:10,123
- What?
- He used your ID.

1157
01:08:14,200 --> 01:08:16,168
What are you doing, Rhodes?

1158
01:08:43,640 --> 01:08:45,688
- Atlas, hey.
- Dylan.

1159
01:08:45,760 --> 01:08:47,285
- I blew it, I'm sorry.
- What are you doing here?

1160
01:08:47,360 --> 01:08:48,600
I'm here to help now.

1161
01:08:48,680 --> 01:08:49,966
Okay, we definitely
don't need your help.

1162
01:08:50,040 --> 01:08:51,326
I know I messed up, all right?

1163
01:08:51,400 --> 01:08:52,925
Yeah, you put everybody's
lives in danger.

1164
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:55,367
- Where is everybody?
- Where is everybody?

1165
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:57,090
I can't be seen with you,
actually, right now.

1166
01:08:57,160 --> 01:08:59,128
I got it now, okay?
I appreciate you taking

1167
01:08:59,200 --> 01:09:00,770
the time to take control
for a little while.

1168
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:02,524
- Hey, I'm actually... Yeah?
- Yeah, but I got it now, all right?

1169
01:09:02,600 --> 01:09:03,647
- You do?
- Yeah.

1170
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:05,051
You look like you can
get some rest, buddy.

1171
01:09:05,160 --> 01:09:07,640
- Who you meeting here?
- I'm not meeting anybody.

1172
01:09:07,720 --> 01:09:09,210
They told me at long's
you were meeting somebody.

1173
01:09:09,280 --> 01:09:11,203
At long's?

1174
01:09:11,280 --> 01:09:14,090
Okay, yeah, no, I am...

1175
01:09:14,160 --> 01:09:16,561
I'm meeting somebody from the Eye.

1176
01:09:16,640 --> 01:09:17,880
Yeah, no, they agreed to meet me

1177
01:09:17,960 --> 01:09:20,964
to exchange this computer chip
for our lives back.

1178
01:09:21,040 --> 01:09:22,280
So that's what it's come to now.

1179
01:09:22,360 --> 01:09:24,169
I hope you're happy
with the situation you've put us in.

1180
01:09:24,240 --> 01:09:25,765
You're talking to the Eye?

1181
01:09:25,840 --> 01:09:26,921
Yeah.

1182
01:09:27,000 --> 01:09:28,843
Why are you talking to the Eye?

1183
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:32,810
Atlas.
Atlas, give me the stick.

1184
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:35,167
Dylan, you're not our
leader anymore, okay?

1185
01:09:35,240 --> 01:09:37,891
You're not our hero.
You're not FBI.

1186
01:09:37,960 --> 01:09:40,930
You're not a magician.
You're not really anything.

1187
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:43,844
And we trusted you for a year.

1188
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:46,321
So if you really wanna help us...
If you really...

1189
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:49,006
If you really wanna help us,
you would leave.

1190
01:09:57,440 --> 01:10:00,728
I get it. Cool. Bye.

1191
01:10:18,400 --> 01:10:19,606
Hello, hello!

1192
01:10:19,680 --> 01:10:22,490
Yeah, that was me you called
at the magic shop.

1193
01:10:22,960 --> 01:10:25,930
So much fun though, knowing you'd be
scurrying away from me at the lab

1194
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,445
just to bring it to me here.

1195
01:10:27,520 --> 01:10:29,170
Did you actually think I'd let you go?

1196
01:10:29,240 --> 01:10:31,925
- How did you do that?
- Everyone has their button.

1197
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:36,005
You push it and they go blind.
And yours, obviously, is ego.

1198
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:37,570
"Stay the course.

1199
01:10:37,640 --> 01:10:40,405
<i>Great changes are in store.</i>

1200
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:43,006
<i>Trust that your unique talents</i>

1201
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:44,650
will not go unrecognized."

1202
01:10:45,920 --> 01:10:47,365
- That was you.
- Yeah.

1203
01:10:47,440 --> 01:10:48,965
Merritt downloaded all the files,

1204
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:51,771
but how do you think
we were able to find him?

1205
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:52,921
Your phone.

1206
01:10:54,840 --> 01:10:56,808
I asked to see the face
behind all of this.

1207
01:10:56,880 --> 01:11:00,043
What you actually put your phone on
was a bi-wave siphon pad.

1208
01:11:01,560 --> 01:11:05,770
Once again,
science beats magic.

1209
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:08,527
- So, the stick?
- No.

1210
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:12,641
I got it!

1211
01:11:12,720 --> 01:11:14,165
I got it. I got it.

1212
01:11:16,200 --> 01:11:18,089
- Fuck, Dylan!
- Wait, leave them!

1213
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:19,605
You really think
I'm gonna walk away from you?

1214
01:11:19,680 --> 01:11:21,170
Give me the stick!

1215
01:11:21,880 --> 01:11:22,961
Give me it!

1216
01:11:23,040 --> 01:11:26,010
All right.
Don't ever question me again. Beat it!

1217
01:11:36,840 --> 01:11:39,320
- So, the stick.
- Go to hell.

1218
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:41,161
Boys.

1219
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:55,563
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

1220
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:13,291
There's like 10 of you.

1221
01:12:13,360 --> 01:12:15,169
Come on, he's just doing tricks.

1222
01:12:15,240 --> 01:12:17,129
He's there! Go!

1223
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:45,481
Dylan, watch the pretty birdies fly.
And sleep.

1224
01:13:45,840 --> 01:13:49,128
- Doesn't work on me.
- Not even as a distraction?

1225
01:13:51,840 --> 01:13:54,446
- Good job.
- Nice to be involved.

1226
01:14:02,720 --> 01:14:04,768
Hey, guys! Guys! Hey!

1227
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:07,491
- I just saw Dylan, something happened.
- What do you mean you just saw Dylan?

1228
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:09,608
Dylan's here?
What happened?

1229
01:14:09,680 --> 01:14:12,160
- Atlas.
- I don't know.

1230
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:18,161
What are they doing?

1231
01:14:18,240 --> 01:14:20,686
Those are Walter's men.

1232
01:14:20,880 --> 01:14:22,530
This is what they want.

1233
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:26,087
What the hell?
How do you still have that?

1234
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:32,849
That's Lionel Shrike's safe.

1235
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:35,446
What the hell
do they want with that?

1236
01:14:35,520 --> 01:14:37,284
Okay, we gotta
follow that truck.

1237
01:14:37,360 --> 01:14:40,682
They must have Dylan.
We don't have much time.

1238
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:46,320
What do you want?

1239
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:51,042
You to understand something
very important.

1240
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:54,363
We are mirror images.

1241
01:14:54,440 --> 01:14:55,771
You see, because like you,

1242
01:14:55,840 --> 01:14:58,081
I share a very deep connection
with my father.

1243
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:04,401
And like you, I'll stop at nothing
to avenge any wrongs done to him.

1244
01:15:09,080 --> 01:15:12,641
You know the only difference
between your father and mine?

1245
01:15:12,720 --> 01:15:14,609
Mine's still alive.

1246
01:15:15,320 --> 01:15:16,526
Get him up.

1247
01:15:30,040 --> 01:15:34,364
So, this is the man

1248
01:15:34,440 --> 01:15:37,523
who spent a lifetime
plotting against me.

1249
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:41,841
I wouldn't have known your face

1250
01:15:41,920 --> 01:15:45,402
if it had been on a billboard
outside my bedroom window.

1251
01:15:45,480 --> 01:15:49,166
But you have spent, what,
30 years thinking about mine?

1252
01:15:49,240 --> 01:15:50,526
When my father died,

1253
01:15:50,600 --> 01:15:52,728
your insurance company
denied my mother her claims.

1254
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,131
- I wouldn't even have known...
- She died a pauper!

1255
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:56,043
...who your mother was.

1256
01:15:56,120 --> 01:16:00,728
She was a digit, a nanobyte
in a stream of data.

1257
01:16:00,800 --> 01:16:02,768
Because nothing is personal to you

1258
01:16:02,840 --> 01:16:05,127
and everyone and everything
is just a number, isn't that so?

1259
01:16:05,200 --> 01:16:07,806
That is where you are wrong,
Mr. Rhodes.

1260
01:16:07,880 --> 01:16:12,807
Once you made yourself known
it became very personal.

1261
01:16:14,080 --> 01:16:15,923
- My son...
- Yeah, the sociopath.

1262
01:16:16,000 --> 01:16:20,562
Funny thing is, I have seven
so-called legitimate children.

1263
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:23,689
Sniveling, snobbish, stupid runts.

1264
01:16:23,760 --> 01:16:27,731
I have one illegitimate child
who is a lot like me.

1265
01:16:27,800 --> 01:16:30,167
The point is,
he wants something,

1266
01:16:30,240 --> 01:16:35,406
and like any good parent, I will
stop at nothing to get it for him.

1267
01:16:35,480 --> 01:16:37,209
Your Horsemen have it.

1268
01:16:37,320 --> 01:16:41,609
You will turn it and them
over to us, now.

1269
01:16:41,680 --> 01:16:42,761
No.

1270
01:16:46,520 --> 01:16:49,285
Dylan, I would like you
to really take this moment in

1271
01:16:49,360 --> 01:16:52,762
because this is the consequence
of your personal vendetta come to life

1272
01:16:52,840 --> 01:16:54,604
and staring you in the face.

1273
01:16:54,680 --> 01:16:56,444
I want you to know
that when you're gone,

1274
01:16:56,520 --> 01:16:57,567
we're not going to stop.

1275
01:16:57,640 --> 01:16:59,768
We're gonna destroy
everything you believe in,

1276
01:16:59,840 --> 01:17:02,047
starting with the Horsemen,
and ending with the Eye.

1277
01:17:02,120 --> 01:17:04,009
Now then, cast your mind back

1278
01:17:04,080 --> 01:17:07,209
to standing by the banks of the river
watching your father descend,

1279
01:17:07,280 --> 01:17:09,282
disgraced and discredited.

1280
01:17:09,360 --> 01:17:12,125
The horrid psychic pain
as you have relived for years.

1281
01:17:12,880 --> 01:17:16,168
I felt that same thing two years ago

1282
01:17:16,240 --> 01:17:19,369
as you drained not just my father's
fortune, but his dignity!

1283
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:21,922
And yet you took pleasure from it.

1284
01:17:24,760 --> 01:17:27,366
This should bring back
some childhood memories.

1285
01:17:54,760 --> 01:17:56,603
- Would you like some tea?
- Oh. Thank you.

1286
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:14,607
- You ready?
- Over to you.

1287
01:18:21,600 --> 01:18:22,647
Splash!

1288
01:18:26,200 --> 01:18:27,565
Job done!

1289
01:18:43,200 --> 01:18:46,602
Hell is going to
seem like a day at the spa

1290
01:18:46,680 --> 01:18:49,160
by the time we're through
with these Horsemen.

1291
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:51,891
- Wouldn't you say?
- You had me at "hell."

1292
01:19:08,800 --> 01:19:11,167
<i>I love you so much.</i>

1293
01:19:13,760 --> 01:19:16,161
Always keep something up my sleeve.

1294
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:38,009
I wish I could dredge
from the muck of my soul

1295
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:42,165
one speck of remorse,
but I can't.

1296
01:20:42,240 --> 01:20:48,691
So I'll stick to the business at hand
and try not to smile too broadly.

1297
01:20:48,760 --> 01:20:54,085
And thank you for delivering
Mr. Dylan Rhodes.

1298
01:20:54,880 --> 01:20:56,609
I take it it's done.

1299
01:20:57,920 --> 01:20:59,888
Literally hit the bottom.

1300
01:21:00,480 --> 01:21:06,249
- Now, where are the Horsemen?
- They're performers.

1301
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:11,884
Their pride, their ego, their need
to be adored are all too powerful

1302
01:21:11,960 --> 01:21:13,849
to keep them out of
the limelight for long.

1303
01:21:13,920 --> 01:21:19,404
If they don't make themselves known,
you will find yourself

1304
01:21:19,520 --> 01:21:23,491
in a very similar position
to Mr. Rhodes.

1305
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:27,406
- Are we clear about that?
- As clear as the water he's under.

1306
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:38,441
You'll have the rest
when I have the Horsemen.

1307
01:22:10,720 --> 01:22:11,767
Dylan!

1308
01:22:13,240 --> 01:22:15,561
Dylan, come on, buddy, breathe!

1309
01:22:15,640 --> 01:22:16,846
- Dylan.
- Dylan?

1310
01:22:16,920 --> 01:22:19,002
Dylan, come on!

1311
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:24,645
You're okay.

1312
01:22:26,080 --> 01:22:28,765
Jesus! You scared
the hell out of us, man.

1313
01:22:28,880 --> 01:22:32,487
- Are you all right, bro?
- Okay!

1314
01:22:32,560 --> 01:22:34,528
- Thank you!
- This is the least I could do.

1315
01:22:34,600 --> 01:22:36,523
No. There's a hell of a lot
less you could've done.

1316
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:37,931
That was not an option.

1317
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,889
You took a bullet for us, it was huge.

1318
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:41,803
You really did, man.

1319
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:46,284
Thanks for pulling me out.
Seriously.

1320
01:22:47,240 --> 01:22:48,605
Yeah.

1321
01:22:48,680 --> 01:22:50,808
You got yourself out.
We did the easy part.

1322
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:53,121
Literally, in my case,
I was just standing on the shore

1323
01:22:53,200 --> 01:22:54,531
while Atlas jumped down and got you.

1324
01:22:54,600 --> 01:22:56,125
I'm serious.

1325
01:22:56,720 --> 01:22:58,609
Hey, you guys.
Something's not right.

1326
01:22:58,680 --> 01:23:00,409
- What's wrong?
- What?

1327
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,321
- It's fake.
- What?

1328
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:07,605
No, I had the stick.

1329
01:23:07,680 --> 01:23:10,331
The actual stick.
I swear, it was in my hand,

1330
01:23:10,400 --> 01:23:12,926
in the lab, and then I put it in
the little case thing.

1331
01:23:13,000 --> 01:23:15,128
- And I gave it to Atlas.
- Right, which I then gave to Dylan.

1332
01:23:15,200 --> 01:23:17,726
Is there any chance you've possibly
misplaced it at any point?

1333
01:23:17,800 --> 01:23:21,168
No, I took it from you
and then slipped it back in your coat

1334
01:23:21,240 --> 01:23:23,004
when I pushed you out.

1335
01:23:23,080 --> 01:23:26,289
Either way, we're left holding
a whole sack full of nada.

1336
01:23:26,360 --> 01:23:28,966
Yeah, but they're gonna come after us
as if we do have something.

1337
01:23:29,040 --> 01:23:32,408
No. Okay. I agree that somebody
got the better of us. Okay? Somehow.

1338
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:34,881
But I don't agree
that we have a sack full of nada.

1339
01:23:34,960 --> 01:23:38,123
Because we're all here.
That's a sack full of something.

1340
01:23:39,120 --> 01:23:45,810
Listen, we all know that Walter is not
going to stop until he gets that chip.

1341
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:49,441
And we're the only ones
that even know that he's alive.

1342
01:23:49,520 --> 01:23:54,128
We can't just walk away.
That's not what the Horsemen do.

1343
01:23:56,920 --> 01:23:58,729
There's a quote.

1344
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:00,211
It's actually by the magician

1345
01:24:00,280 --> 01:24:02,044
that made me wanna do this
in the first place.

1346
01:24:02,120 --> 01:24:04,043
It's...

1347
01:24:04,120 --> 01:24:10,810
"A magician's greatest power lies
forever shrouded in his empty fist."

1348
01:24:10,880 --> 01:24:13,201
"And the very idea
that he can convince the world

1349
01:24:13,280 --> 01:24:16,443
that he is, in fact,
carrying with him a secret."

1350
01:24:16,520 --> 01:24:19,364
- That's Lionel Shrike.
- Right.

1351
01:24:20,600 --> 01:24:21,681
So what are you saying?

1352
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:24,969
That we should pretend like
we have something we don't?

1353
01:24:28,040 --> 01:24:31,442
- What is Walter's greatest fear?
- Being seen.

1354
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:35,525
- And what does the stick do?
- The stick can unencode anything.

1355
01:24:35,600 --> 01:24:40,527
It can open up a back door
into any computer on the planet.

1356
01:24:40,600 --> 01:24:42,602
- Including his.
- Yeah.

1357
01:24:44,240 --> 01:24:46,686
Right, we not only make him
think that we have it,

1358
01:24:46,760 --> 01:24:50,845
but that we're going to use it
to expose and destroy him.

1359
01:24:50,920 --> 01:24:54,288
We need a plan.
But we don't have time.

1360
01:24:54,400 --> 01:24:57,847
We have each other
and there are five of us.

1361
01:24:57,920 --> 01:25:00,844
But we also need supplies, right?
And resources.

1362
01:25:00,920 --> 01:25:04,208
And probably more than five people.

1363
01:25:04,280 --> 01:25:08,171
Do you really think
you don't have help?

1364
01:25:08,240 --> 01:25:11,005
Oh, she speaks English.
Of course. Yeah.

1365
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:16,484
Do you know why the Fool is
the most powerful card in the tarot?

1366
01:25:16,560 --> 01:25:20,201
Not because the person
who draws him is a fool.

1367
01:25:20,280 --> 01:25:24,729
He's a fool because he's a clean slate,

1368
01:25:24,800 --> 01:25:28,725
and, therefore, can become anything.

1369
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:30,086
You were chosen.

1370
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:32,689
All of you.

1371
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:37,971
Not because of who you are,
but because of who you might become.

1372
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:43,446
When you say "chosen"...
Are you part of the Eye?

1373
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:47,570
Yes. We are part of the Eye.

1374
01:25:47,640 --> 01:25:50,849
You've each doubted our existence.

1375
01:25:51,680 --> 01:25:56,004
Wondering if we,
indeed, were watching.

1376
01:25:59,600 --> 01:26:03,241
We are.
We always have been.

1377
01:26:03,320 --> 01:26:05,846
This is the best
magic shop in the world.

1378
01:26:05,920 --> 01:26:08,127
- You know what she's saying, right?
- Yes.

1379
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:10,601
That now we have
resources and help.

1380
01:26:12,400 --> 01:26:13,765
Thank you.

1381
01:26:16,240 --> 01:26:17,924
So, who's in?

1382
01:26:21,720 --> 01:26:24,326
- I'm in.
- Yeah, I'm in.

1383
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:28,161
Let's do this.

1384
01:26:45,880 --> 01:26:47,564
No, no, no.

1385
01:26:50,200 --> 01:26:52,328
<i>Not long ago, we were tricked.</i>

1386
01:26:52,400 --> 01:26:55,324
<i>I was exposed
and brought back from the dead.</i>

1387
01:26:55,400 --> 01:26:58,244
<i>So we thought it was only fitting
that we do the same thing</i>

1388
01:26:58,320 --> 01:27:02,689
<i>- to the person who did it to us.
- Midnight, New Year's Eve. London.</i>

1389
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:06,003
<i>We will be performing a series of shows
that all connect to our big finale,</i>

1390
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:08,242
<i>so pay close attention to each trick.</i>

1391
01:27:08,320 --> 01:27:09,401
Get my father.

1392
01:27:11,560 --> 01:27:12,641
Run!

1393
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:15,883
I want Interpol, Scotland Yard,
whoever we have in London.

1394
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:17,240
What do we know about Rhodes?

1395
01:27:17,320 --> 01:27:19,163
Wherever the Horsemen are,
that's where he is.

1396
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:20,366
Let's get to the airport.

1397
01:27:20,440 --> 01:27:22,761
<i>So leave your kiddies
at home and get ready for a wild night,</i>

1398
01:27:23,600 --> 01:27:25,921
<i>because we, too, will bring
someone back from the dead.</i>

1399
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:27,889
Let's move, everyone!

1400
01:27:27,960 --> 01:27:29,849
<i>In front of
the largest stage in the world...</i>

1401
01:27:29,920 --> 01:27:31,843
<i>The actual world.</i>

1402
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:35,686
You know they're playing you, right?
Leading you into a trap?

1403
01:27:35,760 --> 01:27:37,410
Yeah, but the threat is real.

1404
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:40,171
This card can hack into any system
on the planet, including ours.

1405
01:27:40,240 --> 01:27:42,481
They have it, why wouldn't
they use it to expose us?

1406
01:27:42,560 --> 01:27:44,050
Me. Everything we've done.

1407
01:27:44,120 --> 01:27:46,168
Is it real, Mr. McKinney?

1408
01:27:53,560 --> 01:27:54,800
The threat is real.

1409
01:27:54,880 --> 01:27:57,167
So, how do we stay
ahead of them?

1410
01:27:57,240 --> 01:27:59,607
We need to get
to London by midnight.

1411
01:28:08,320 --> 01:28:09,845
<i>We are here in London</i>

1412
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:12,400
<i>on this New Year's Eve,
and the crowds are out in force.</i>

1413
01:28:12,480 --> 01:28:13,970
<i>Locals and tourists alike</i>

1414
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:16,168
<i>getting ready for
the party of the year.</i>

1415
01:28:16,240 --> 01:28:18,163
<i>A video gone viral from the infamous</i>

1416
01:28:18,240 --> 01:28:20,083
<i>Horsemen magicians has surfaced.</i>

1417
01:28:20,160 --> 01:28:21,844
<i>They promise
to make a grand reappearance.</i>

1418
01:28:21,920 --> 01:28:25,003
<i>But will it end in
their arrest on national television?</i>

1419
01:28:25,080 --> 01:28:26,764
<i>Or some sort of vindication?</i>

1420
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:28,922
<i>Who knows where they'll show up...</i>

1421
01:28:29,000 --> 01:28:30,206
<i>But we do know, wherever,</i>

1422
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:33,601
<i>whenever that is,
people will be watching.</i>

1423
01:28:35,320 --> 01:28:37,243
Yeah, texts, tweets, Instagrams.

1424
01:28:37,320 --> 01:28:40,290
Anything that says "Horsemen,"
brags about seeing the Horsemen,

1425
01:28:40,360 --> 01:28:42,044
tag them and bundle them.

1426
01:28:42,120 --> 01:28:44,487
Dad, who do we have security-wise
on this? Your guys?

1427
01:28:44,560 --> 01:28:45,721
Whoever you want.

1428
01:28:45,840 --> 01:28:47,683
Well, we want all of them
and all their friends.

1429
01:28:47,800 --> 01:28:49,848
Anyone who wants to work
stationed throughout the city,

1430
01:28:49,920 --> 01:28:51,729
so they can be anywhere in 60 seconds.

1431
01:29:06,000 --> 01:29:08,810
Hello! Hey!

1432
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:12,004
My name's Jack Wilder.

1433
01:29:12,840 --> 01:29:14,808
Goddamn, it feels good to be back.

1434
01:29:16,400 --> 01:29:18,482
All right, gather around. Indulge me.

1435
01:29:18,560 --> 01:29:20,767
I wanna talk to you about
something real quick.

1436
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:24,731
You all know Three Card Monte,
also known as "Find the Lady"?

1437
01:29:24,800 --> 01:29:29,124
Trick performed by street hustlers all
over the world. And why street hustlers?

1438
01:29:29,200 --> 01:29:32,090
Because as soon as you walk up
to the table, you lose.

1439
01:29:32,160 --> 01:29:34,128
Every time.
Let me demonstrate.

1440
01:29:36,600 --> 01:29:40,730
While we're at it,
let's find ourselves a life-sized Queen.

1441
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:42,723
Ma'am, would you
mind being my Queen?

1442
01:29:46,040 --> 01:29:48,407
Don't worry. I promise you
there's a 50 percent chance

1443
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:49,766
you'll get her back after the show.

1444
01:29:49,840 --> 01:29:51,649
Head over there.
Thank you very much.

1445
01:29:51,720 --> 01:29:55,247
All right. Let's find ourselves
some Jacks to serve our Queen!

1446
01:29:55,320 --> 01:29:56,606
<i>Trust me, gentlemen.</i>

1447
01:29:56,680 --> 01:30:00,446
I know how these guys work now.
They're gonna start with a tease.

1448
01:30:00,520 --> 01:30:02,488
A few little pop-ups.

1449
01:30:02,560 --> 01:30:05,450
<i>Something to lure you in. Like...</i>

1450
01:30:05,520 --> 01:30:09,650
Well, you know, like Three Card Monte,
where the guy goes,

1451
01:30:09,720 --> 01:30:12,291
"Looky here, but no, no, looky here!"

1452
01:30:12,360 --> 01:30:16,285
<i>Except when all these
little tricks are done,</i>

1453
01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:18,442
<i>the only thing
you're gonna be looking at</i>

1454
01:30:18,520 --> 01:30:22,525
is the inside of your own colon,
with the words

1455
01:30:22,600 --> 01:30:25,524
<i>"Horsemen" written all over it.</i>

1456
01:30:26,240 --> 01:30:27,810
In blood.

1457
01:30:27,880 --> 01:30:31,362
We get the picture, Mr. McKinney.

1458
01:30:31,440 --> 01:30:33,488
And get out of my chair.

1459
01:30:33,560 --> 01:30:35,767
Hello, everybody!

1460
01:30:35,840 --> 01:30:37,808
Come close, come on!

1461
01:30:37,880 --> 01:30:39,803
All right, all right, so listen.

1462
01:30:39,880 --> 01:30:45,364
Tonight, I am going to make
something fly using actual magic.

1463
01:30:45,440 --> 01:30:47,204
- Are you ready?
- Yeah!

1464
01:30:47,280 --> 01:30:50,329
I'm going to take
a very large vessel,

1465
01:30:50,400 --> 01:30:54,769
I'm gonna make it fly over there
and land on the Thames.

1466
01:30:54,840 --> 01:30:56,683
Can you handle that?

1467
01:30:56,760 --> 01:30:58,285
Same rules apply as before.

1468
01:30:58,360 --> 01:31:00,442
All you need to do is
keep your eye on the Queen.

1469
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:01,885
It's as simple as that.

1470
01:31:01,960 --> 01:31:03,689
- Are you guys ready?
- Yeah!

1471
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:05,205
Dad, look at this.

1472
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:07,891
Tag this one.
Where does it come from?

1473
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:10,088
Near the river.
Looks like the shows are starting.

1474
01:31:10,160 --> 01:31:11,685
But we're not the only ones
who found them.

1475
01:31:11,760 --> 01:31:13,364
- What do you mean?
- It's on Channel One.

1476
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:22,846
- Let's go to 2.
- Here we go.

1477
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:25,526
Got him. We have a location.

1478
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:27,568
It's Jack Wilder.
Here come the Horsemen.

1479
01:31:27,640 --> 01:31:29,608
Okay, we're moving.
Let's go, let's go.

1480
01:31:29,680 --> 01:31:31,409
Typing in grid coordinates now.

1481
01:31:33,200 --> 01:31:35,851
Turn around.
Hide yourselves with the cards.

1482
01:31:36,480 --> 01:31:39,689
And here we go. Switch!

1483
01:31:41,160 --> 01:31:43,288
You guys still have your eye on her?
You want me to go back and do it?

1484
01:31:43,360 --> 01:31:46,443
Okay, all right. I'm moving on.
And switch.

1485
01:31:48,440 --> 01:31:49,487
Where is she?

1486
01:31:50,840 --> 01:31:52,888
Down at the end?
You sure?

1487
01:31:52,960 --> 01:31:55,770
All right, can I get a drumroll
from my man in the back?

1488
01:31:55,840 --> 01:31:57,763
Thank you very much.

1489
01:32:03,680 --> 01:32:05,762
There's my girl.

1490
01:32:06,240 --> 01:32:08,846
Not my girl, 100 percent your girl.

1491
01:32:08,960 --> 01:32:10,291
But just in this situation.

1492
01:32:10,360 --> 01:32:13,011
Okay, but I gotta warm up
a little bit first. Okay?

1493
01:32:13,080 --> 01:32:16,971
So, let me just
make something small fly, like...

1494
01:32:17,040 --> 01:32:19,168
Fly, fly, fly!

1495
01:32:19,240 --> 01:32:22,642
Wow, right? Look at that!
Come on, people.

1496
01:32:22,760 --> 01:32:25,650
Tough crowd. You, fly!

1497
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:26,846
- Me?
- Check your fly.

1498
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:31,964
You like that?

1499
01:32:32,040 --> 01:32:33,929
You support that relationship?

1500
01:32:34,000 --> 01:32:36,890
That guy had a bird in his pants.
That's disgusting.

1501
01:32:40,560 --> 01:32:42,608
<i>Copy that.
We've got two sightings reported.</i>

1502
01:32:42,680 --> 01:32:45,604
<i>- Heading to Greenwich Market.</i>
- Get me Thaddeus.

1503
01:32:45,680 --> 01:32:47,967
<i>Thaddeus, the FBI are here.
They're moving.</i>

1504
01:32:48,080 --> 01:32:51,163
Let 'em move.
That's what the Horsemen want.

1505
01:32:51,240 --> 01:32:52,924
Well, what if they get there first?
That can't happen.

1506
01:32:53,000 --> 01:32:55,128
<i>I guarantee you, they won't.</i>

1507
01:32:55,200 --> 01:32:56,406
Find the pattern.

1508
01:32:57,360 --> 01:33:00,330
You do that, and you'll be able
to cut them off

1509
01:33:00,400 --> 01:33:02,801
<i>before they get to their final trick.</i>

1510
01:33:02,880 --> 01:33:06,601
If it makes you feel better,
I'll take care of the FBI.

1511
01:33:19,880 --> 01:33:22,326
OK, well, I guess you found me!

1512
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:23,970
We've got a third spot.

1513
01:33:24,040 --> 01:33:26,566
Okay, everybody,
we're getting a pattern.

1514
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:34,010
Give me two, 13 and 21.

1515
01:33:35,080 --> 01:33:37,970
What the hell is that?
Freeze that and zoom in.

1516
01:33:40,080 --> 01:33:42,845
How the hell did this happen?

1517
01:33:42,960 --> 01:33:46,089
He's dead. We watched him drown.
How the hell did this happen?

1518
01:33:46,160 --> 01:33:48,686
Given that it did happen,
the pertinent question is,

1519
01:33:48,760 --> 01:33:49,761
what are we gonna do about it?

1520
01:33:49,840 --> 01:33:51,604
We're gonna stop him, Dad.
We'll stop him.

1521
01:33:51,680 --> 01:33:52,761
Where's my coat?

1522
01:33:52,840 --> 01:33:55,571
Walter, for the record,
I never loved the safe idea.

1523
01:33:55,640 --> 01:33:57,165
Oh, I know
where they're going.

1524
01:33:57,240 --> 01:33:59,846
The next show is Merritt's
and it's by the river.

1525
01:33:59,920 --> 01:34:01,331
Chase, you need
to get to him

1526
01:34:01,400 --> 01:34:03,402
so we can find the Horsemen's
entry point for the finale.

1527
01:34:09,240 --> 01:34:12,881
I have a confession to make. I've been
told I have some control issues.

1528
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:16,322
I've learned that it's really,
really hard to control people,

1529
01:34:16,400 --> 01:34:20,325
so I'm gonna try to control something
that's a lot easier than people.

1530
01:34:20,400 --> 01:34:21,811
I'm gonna try to
control the weather.

1531
01:34:21,880 --> 01:34:23,769
Yeah, rain...

1532
01:34:26,160 --> 01:34:27,810
It'd be a little difficult
to make it rain, right?

1533
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:30,645
That would be something
that only God can do, right?

1534
01:34:30,720 --> 01:34:33,007
I'm gonna do something
that God can't do.

1535
01:34:33,080 --> 01:34:35,970
I'm not just gonna make it clear up.
No, no, no.

1536
01:34:36,040 --> 01:34:38,122
I'm gonna make it actually stop.

1537
01:34:51,440 --> 01:34:54,649
And can God do that?
No, I don't think so.

1538
01:34:54,720 --> 01:34:57,087
Or what about make it go up?

1539
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:06,762
Are you still with me?

1540
01:35:06,840 --> 01:35:09,889
Watch the Queen on the left.
Let's do it. Turn around.

1541
01:35:13,240 --> 01:35:14,366
Switch!

1542
01:35:18,080 --> 01:35:19,241
Show me the lady.

1543
01:35:19,320 --> 01:35:22,130
Show me the lady!

1544
01:35:22,200 --> 01:35:23,406
The end? End?

1545
01:35:25,880 --> 01:35:27,882
You know what?
I'm actually starting to feel kinda bad.

1546
01:35:29,000 --> 01:35:32,129
It's just because I can actually feel
that you guys are paying attention.

1547
01:35:32,200 --> 01:35:33,804
It's just that...

1548
01:35:33,880 --> 01:35:37,327
You know, it's unfortunate
that it's the wrong kind of attention.

1549
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:41,040
Yeah, we need a fresher bird.

1550
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:45,323
He's so cute. He's so cute!

1551
01:35:45,400 --> 01:35:47,129
Let's kill him, right?

1552
01:35:48,240 --> 01:35:52,211
- Merritt, move into position.
- Got it, Dylan.

1553
01:35:52,280 --> 01:35:53,964
I'm on my way.
I'll see you there.

1554
01:35:54,040 --> 01:35:56,407
Lula, stand by, all right?

1555
01:35:56,520 --> 01:35:58,841
Or, what about just go,
I don't know, just go insane?

1556
01:36:08,400 --> 01:36:10,846
<i>Reports are coming in
from all over London</i>

1557
01:36:10,920 --> 01:36:14,527
<i>as the Horsemen appear to have taken
over the whole city for their show.</i>

1558
01:36:17,560 --> 01:36:21,246
Hey, broski-whaddya-knowski?
Where you headed?

1559
01:36:21,320 --> 01:36:22,606
- Please, bro, don't do this.
- Where are you headed?

1560
01:36:22,680 --> 01:36:24,489
North, south, east?

1561
01:36:25,360 --> 01:36:26,885
East. Tower of London?

1562
01:36:26,960 --> 01:36:29,725
Tower Bridge?
Near Tower Bridge? The Thames!

1563
01:36:29,800 --> 01:36:34,328
You're going to the Thamesy-Whemsy!
You're so easy!

1564
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:37,051
Bro, if there's any chance of us
ever having a relationship...

1565
01:36:37,120 --> 01:36:39,521
There's not.
Where's your entry?

1566
01:36:39,600 --> 01:36:43,400
South Bank? Greenwich? Greenwich.

1567
01:36:43,480 --> 01:36:47,087
I know where you're going.
I know where...

1568
01:36:48,440 --> 01:36:49,805
Watch it, hobo.

1569
01:36:52,720 --> 01:36:55,246
Hey, Merritt. Oh, come on.
Tell me you're kidding. How?

1570
01:36:57,040 --> 01:36:58,405
When?

1571
01:36:58,480 --> 01:37:01,131
Shit. All right. All right, I got it.

1572
01:37:01,200 --> 01:37:03,248
Don't worry about it.
I'll warn the others.

1573
01:37:06,200 --> 01:37:07,884
Sorry. Just...

1574
01:37:10,520 --> 01:37:11,601
What? I just told you...

1575
01:37:11,720 --> 01:37:12,721
Phone call.

1576
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:15,201
- Hello?
<i>- Lula.</i>

1577
01:37:15,280 --> 01:37:18,648
Dylan. Yeah, kind of in the middle
of something right now.

1578
01:37:18,720 --> 01:37:21,291
<i>Wrap it up.
Meet me at the rendezvous point now.</i>

1579
01:37:21,360 --> 01:37:22,646
- What?
<i>- Now!</i>

1580
01:37:23,320 --> 01:37:25,288
Was that an act of God?

1581
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:28,483
No. No, no, no,
that was an act of me

1582
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:31,723
and the strobe lights
and rain machines.

1583
01:37:31,800 --> 01:37:33,723
And I hope you guys
were paying attention.

1584
01:37:33,800 --> 01:37:35,962
Because you're gonna need to know
all of that for the final.

1585
01:37:39,560 --> 01:37:42,643
So how did I do it?
Did I use a Barry Trap?

1586
01:37:42,720 --> 01:37:45,041
Maybe some switches
or a few duplicates?

1587
01:37:45,120 --> 01:37:46,167
<i>Jack, go now!</i>

1588
01:37:46,240 --> 01:37:47,287
You know what?
I hate to say it.

1589
01:37:47,360 --> 01:37:49,124
You're gonna have to wait to find out.
I know.

1590
01:37:49,200 --> 01:37:51,601
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I love you all.

1591
01:37:55,040 --> 01:37:56,121
<i>Lula, go!</i>

1592
01:37:56,200 --> 01:37:58,282
I have to go.

1593
01:38:17,160 --> 01:38:21,370
Out of the way, FBI!
Move, move, move! Go!

1594
01:38:21,440 --> 01:38:23,169
Get some men in that park!

1595
01:38:23,240 --> 01:38:24,366
Men in the park, now!

1596
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:26,568
You gonna fill up on appetizers?

1597
01:38:26,640 --> 01:38:29,291
Or save room for
the main course?

1598
01:38:29,360 --> 01:38:31,169
Where the hell
are the Horsemen?

1599
01:38:31,240 --> 01:38:32,480
You can chase them
all you want,

1600
01:38:32,560 --> 01:38:35,040
you're just gonna wind up
holding your own tails.

1601
01:38:36,040 --> 01:38:38,850
Or, you can let them
come to you.

1602
01:38:38,920 --> 01:38:40,490
So, what's it gonna be?

1603
01:38:40,600 --> 01:38:41,726
Chase them?

1604
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:44,085
Or make a deal with me?

1605
01:38:50,560 --> 01:38:52,369
Again? How did we
get found out again?

1606
01:38:52,440 --> 01:38:54,169
It's fine, it's fine.
We'll just cut to the finale.

1607
01:38:54,280 --> 01:38:55,770
- Where's Merritt?
- Fine. I don't know.

1608
01:38:55,840 --> 01:38:56,841
I'm here.

1609
01:38:56,920 --> 01:38:58,729
- Where's Lula?
- I'm right here!

1610
01:38:58,800 --> 01:39:00,689
What the hell happened?

1611
01:39:00,760 --> 01:39:02,649
- My goddamn brother happened.
- Don't worry about it.

1612
01:39:02,720 --> 01:39:04,210
We just gotta get to the destination.

1613
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:06,203
- Lula, can you handle that thing?
- I can ride it.

1614
01:39:06,280 --> 01:39:08,282
Have you asked the guys
that question, or just me?

1615
01:39:08,360 --> 01:39:09,600
- Yeah, good point.
- Let's go!

1616
01:39:09,680 --> 01:39:10,761
No, Jack.

1617
01:39:15,440 --> 01:39:16,441
Shit!

1618
01:39:19,400 --> 01:39:20,845
Jack's down. We gotta get him.

1619
01:39:24,200 --> 01:39:25,247
Come on, move!

1620
01:39:30,720 --> 01:39:32,961
- Jack! Go, go!
- That's the brake.

1621
01:39:33,040 --> 01:39:34,644
That's the gas.
You'll figure it out.

1622
01:39:34,720 --> 01:39:36,404
Come on, follow me!

1623
01:39:37,680 --> 01:39:38,681
That's it?

1624
01:39:55,320 --> 01:39:56,924
- Hey, ready?
- Yeah!

1625
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:05,091
Get on.

1626
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:11,048
- Yeah!
- Okay, guys, I'm coming!

1627
01:40:12,120 --> 01:40:13,451
Jesus!

1628
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:16,644
I'm coming!

1629
01:40:24,760 --> 01:40:26,603
- Get up! Come on!
- Okay.

1630
01:40:28,000 --> 01:40:29,206
You got me.

1631
01:40:29,280 --> 01:40:31,442
Those things are really dangerous!

1632
01:40:33,200 --> 01:40:35,407
- Come on!
- Go!

1633
01:40:37,200 --> 01:40:39,362
Get him in! Move it!

1634
01:40:43,800 --> 01:40:45,450
What is happening?

1635
01:40:45,560 --> 01:40:47,801
Where are they?

1636
01:40:47,880 --> 01:40:49,882
They should be
arriving any second.

1637
01:40:51,160 --> 01:40:53,606
That is, if they're gonna
get here by midnight.

1638
01:41:05,880 --> 01:41:08,281
Okay, feeling fear.

1639
01:41:08,640 --> 01:41:11,325
Fear. Anger, anger.

1640
01:41:12,040 --> 01:41:15,044
- Oh, full house!
- That's enough.

1641
01:41:16,640 --> 01:41:18,051
I was done.

1642
01:41:19,000 --> 01:41:23,085
So nice to see you all again.

1643
01:41:23,160 --> 01:41:28,690
But since we're such old friends,
let's skip the formalities.

1644
01:41:29,680 --> 01:41:34,447
One of you
has something we require.

1645
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:37,730
So give it over.

1646
01:41:45,920 --> 01:41:48,207
Nothing at all?

1647
01:41:49,440 --> 01:41:50,601
Really?

1648
01:41:53,680 --> 01:41:55,091
Sit down!

1649
01:42:02,280 --> 01:42:03,725
Let's go, let's go!

1650
01:42:04,960 --> 01:42:06,291
Let's go, let's go!

1651
01:42:06,360 --> 01:42:08,966
Hurry up and move them quickly
before they can do anything.

1652
01:42:09,040 --> 01:42:10,201
Get those lights off me!

1653
01:42:16,000 --> 01:42:17,570
Get on the plane!

1654
01:42:20,520 --> 01:42:21,760
Hey!

1655
01:42:24,400 --> 01:42:25,401
Get on the plane!

1656
01:42:35,040 --> 01:42:36,280
- Hey!
- Hey!

1657
01:42:36,360 --> 01:42:38,249
Yeah, take off immediately.

1658
01:42:41,640 --> 01:42:44,291
You know, you make it almost too easy?

1659
01:42:44,360 --> 01:42:48,046
I mean, even your hilarious attempts
to make yourselves unpredictable,

1660
01:42:48,120 --> 01:42:49,963
just follow the same pattern each time.

1661
01:42:50,040 --> 01:42:52,042
Set up, set up, set up.

1662
01:42:52,120 --> 01:42:53,360
Big reveal.

1663
01:42:53,440 --> 01:42:55,841
Which tonight was going
to be stroke of midnight,

1664
01:42:55,920 --> 01:42:58,651
middle of the Thames?
Tell me if I'm warm.

1665
01:43:03,560 --> 01:43:07,360
Well, there will be a big reveal,
and it will come now.

1666
01:43:09,120 --> 01:43:12,203
The stick, dear boy.

1667
01:43:12,760 --> 01:43:14,046
- No.
- Fine.

1668
01:43:14,600 --> 01:43:16,807
Start with her.

1669
01:43:18,040 --> 01:43:19,201
Hey, hey, hey!

1670
01:43:21,400 --> 01:43:24,802
- Give it to him.
- Danny, give him the card.

1671
01:43:24,880 --> 01:43:26,723
- Just give it to him.
- Danny, come on.

1672
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:37,886
We'll have a closer look.

1673
01:43:46,360 --> 01:43:48,328
Okay, I owe you an apology.

1674
01:43:48,400 --> 01:43:50,687
Leader, you should have
planned an escape, okay?

1675
01:43:50,760 --> 01:43:52,364
- This is the both of us.
- Okay, it's the both of us.

1676
01:43:52,440 --> 01:43:53,930
- Guys, come on!
- Come on, stop!

1677
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,810
- You, to save your little girlfriend!
- To save my...

1678
01:43:56,880 --> 01:43:59,167
- He had a knife to her head!
- I'm a Horseman, you dick!

1679
01:43:59,240 --> 01:44:00,685
All right, you know what?
This is not the time!

1680
01:44:00,760 --> 01:44:02,205
And you, what's your deal, man?

1681
01:44:02,280 --> 01:44:04,408
Look, they're not gonna get blood
all over the seats.

1682
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:06,130
They're probably gonna
throw us out of the plane.

1683
01:44:06,200 --> 01:44:07,486
- Really?
- I'm sorry to interrupt,

1684
01:44:07,560 --> 01:44:09,688
but I just have to
say congratulations.

1685
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:10,966
And thank you!

1686
01:44:12,520 --> 01:44:13,760
It's real.

1687
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:15,251
What?

1688
01:44:15,320 --> 01:44:16,845
It's real?

1689
01:44:18,560 --> 01:44:19,607
Bring them through.

1690
01:44:19,680 --> 01:44:20,761
Did you say it's real?

1691
01:44:20,840 --> 01:44:21,841
What is he talking about?

1692
01:44:21,920 --> 01:44:23,126
Move!

1693
01:44:23,200 --> 01:44:24,725
Well done, my boy.

1694
01:44:28,600 --> 01:44:31,001
Cote Du Marisule champagne.

1695
01:44:31,080 --> 01:44:35,210
It's the most expensive bottle on Earth.

1696
01:44:36,120 --> 01:44:38,248
$1.2 million.

1697
01:44:38,320 --> 01:44:42,325
And I saved it just for this occasion.

1698
01:44:42,400 --> 01:44:46,644
Honestly, same bottle,
Liquor Shack, 700K.

1699
01:44:46,720 --> 01:44:49,849
Hey. You got what you wanted.

1700
01:44:49,920 --> 01:44:52,446
So, does this mean
you're letting us go?

1701
01:44:52,520 --> 01:44:55,444
Knowing what you
know about us? No.

1702
01:44:55,520 --> 01:44:59,206
- You sure?
- Chase, what shall we do?

1703
01:45:01,000 --> 01:45:03,162
Toss them out.

1704
01:45:03,240 --> 01:45:05,811
Get your last words
in quickly, everybody!

1705
01:45:07,760 --> 01:45:11,207
- No! Come on! No!
- Farewell.

1706
01:45:11,560 --> 01:45:13,767
Oh, God! No!

1707
01:45:15,040 --> 01:45:17,441
Wait! I just wanna say...

1708
01:45:17,520 --> 01:45:19,761
I came into the world
with the wrong family,

1709
01:45:19,840 --> 01:45:21,808
but I'm leaving with the right one.

1710
01:45:21,880 --> 01:45:23,450
I love you guys!

1711
01:45:23,520 --> 01:45:24,567
- No!
- No, no, no!

1712
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:28,846
This is how I kicked
you out of the womb.

1713
01:45:28,920 --> 01:45:30,001
No!

1714
01:45:31,520 --> 01:45:32,885
Who's next?

1715
01:45:39,040 --> 01:45:40,883
No, wait! Let me go!

1716
01:45:40,960 --> 01:45:43,281
Let go of me!

1717
01:45:43,360 --> 01:45:45,681
No, no, no!

1718
01:45:45,760 --> 01:45:47,444
- Let me go!
- Toss her!

1719
01:45:50,880 --> 01:45:52,769
Oh, God!

1720
01:45:52,840 --> 01:45:55,844
Hurry up and shut that door!
It's getting cold in here.

1721
01:45:55,920 --> 01:45:57,843
Okay, hit the road, Jack!

1722
01:46:03,480 --> 01:46:04,606
No, no, no!

1723
01:46:06,040 --> 01:46:08,281
A lot of brain,
but not enough brawn.

1724
01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:13,081
Oh, that was fun!

1725
01:46:15,960 --> 01:46:18,964
Cheers! Well done, my boy.

1726
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:27,042
No, is it supposed to taste like that?

1727
01:46:27,160 --> 01:46:28,650
No, it is not.

1728
01:46:48,480 --> 01:46:50,050
What the hell is going on?

1729
01:47:00,040 --> 01:47:02,281
Okay, come pick them up!

1730
01:47:03,000 --> 01:47:04,729
- Come on.
- Come on out.

1731
01:47:18,000 --> 01:47:21,846
<i>Ladies and gentlemen... The Horsemen!</i>

1732
01:47:42,200 --> 01:47:44,441
<i>No, you should feel pretty
good about yourself, man.</i>

1733
01:47:44,560 --> 01:47:48,087
<i>You predicted it correctly.
The Thames, stroke of midnight.</i>

1734
01:47:48,160 --> 01:47:49,969
<i>New Year's Eve. Happy New Year!</i>

1735
01:47:57,000 --> 01:47:58,286
Unbelievable!

1736
01:47:58,360 --> 01:47:59,691
- We are moving now.
- The whole thing just changed.

1737
01:47:59,760 --> 01:48:02,525
- All backup into position stat!
- We're on the move.

1738
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:06,241
- You're staying here!
- Of course.

1739
01:48:13,600 --> 01:48:15,443
Move! Move! Out of the way!

1740
01:48:15,520 --> 01:48:17,761
Wow! Thank you very much, London!

1741
01:48:17,840 --> 01:48:22,129
We would like to acknowledge not just
our old friend, Arthur Tressler.

1742
01:48:22,200 --> 01:48:24,771
But his young and very
brilliant son, Walter Mabry.

1743
01:48:24,840 --> 01:48:27,241
Who has performed one of the
greatest feats of illusion

1744
01:48:27,320 --> 01:48:28,970
even we have ever seen.

1745
01:48:29,040 --> 01:48:33,250
He has, amazingly, brought
himself back from the dead!

1746
01:48:34,200 --> 01:48:37,409
But before he did that,
he revealed someone.

1747
01:48:37,480 --> 01:48:42,611
And we think it only right
to give him a proper introduction.

1748
01:48:42,680 --> 01:48:46,685
He is our friend and he is our leader.
Dylan Shrike!

1749
01:48:46,760 --> 01:48:48,762
- Get over here!
- Yeah!

1750
01:48:54,640 --> 01:49:01,489
So, normally only the magician, his
assistant, and a few trusted stage hands

1751
01:49:01,560 --> 01:49:03,801
know the secret of a trick.

1752
01:49:03,880 --> 01:49:06,884
But tonight, however, in this effect,

1753
01:49:06,960 --> 01:49:10,043
all of you people
around the Thames here.

1754
01:49:10,120 --> 01:49:14,762
And since we're streaming live,
everyone around the world

1755
01:49:14,840 --> 01:49:17,366
already knows everything.

1756
01:49:17,440 --> 01:49:21,525
And only these fellows
here are the ones left in the dark.

1757
01:49:21,600 --> 01:49:24,524
So let's see how closely
you were watching our shows.

1758
01:49:24,600 --> 01:49:28,321
Remember when we were playing
"Find the Lady," and I said

1759
01:49:28,400 --> 01:49:30,323
<i>that we used a Barry Trap.</i>

1760
01:49:31,120 --> 01:49:34,681
<i>Some classic switches
and a few duplicates?</i>

1761
01:49:34,760 --> 01:49:38,287
<i>Well, that's how we switched
the driver of the truck.</i>

1762
01:49:41,360 --> 01:49:43,601
<i>Which took us to a duplicate hangar</i>

1763
01:49:43,720 --> 01:49:46,246
<i>where we used your need to rush,</i>

1764
01:49:46,320 --> 01:49:49,324
<i>and your fear of being seen
let you do the work for us.</i>

1765
01:49:49,400 --> 01:49:51,209
Get those lights off me!

1766
01:49:52,520 --> 01:49:56,764
So, the airplane.
How did we get it to fly?

1767
01:49:57,840 --> 01:50:02,641
<i>Well, we used fans,
and lights and rain machines.</i>

1768
01:50:07,880 --> 01:50:12,522
Obviously, all of this was
reliant on us getting caught.

1769
01:50:12,600 --> 01:50:13,886
But we needed to make sure

1770
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:16,082
that you would do exactly
what we needed you to do

1771
01:50:16,160 --> 01:50:17,650
once you did catch us.

1772
01:50:17,720 --> 01:50:23,807
My brother Chase, who was
technical adviser to the losing team.

1773
01:50:23,880 --> 01:50:26,531
He taught us that it's
all about blind spots.

1774
01:50:26,640 --> 01:50:28,290
I know where you're going!

1775
01:50:28,360 --> 01:50:31,842
And... surprises.

1776
01:50:33,680 --> 01:50:35,205
Watch it, hobo.

1777
01:50:35,280 --> 01:50:36,964
Why don't you watch
the watch I'm wearing,

1778
01:50:37,040 --> 01:50:39,691
the where of where
you're watching, and sleep!

1779
01:50:39,760 --> 01:50:43,082
It's going to be your idea to throw
the Horsemen out of the plane.

1780
01:50:43,160 --> 01:50:45,640
If all of this is
kind of confusing to you,

1781
01:50:45,720 --> 01:50:47,688
I can maybe catch you up on it later.

1782
01:50:47,760 --> 01:50:50,206
Probably see you what, three to five?

1783
01:50:51,360 --> 01:50:55,729
Come on, put it there.
Hey! Tit for tat, bro!

1784
01:50:56,280 --> 01:50:59,250
Basically, we showed them everything.

1785
01:50:59,320 --> 01:51:04,611
How you kidnapped us to steal the very
thing that is in your pocket right now.

1786
01:51:06,840 --> 01:51:08,205
Whoops!

1787
01:51:11,840 --> 01:51:14,286
You know, this thing here,

1788
01:51:14,360 --> 01:51:17,842
which you said you could
use to adjust markets,

1789
01:51:17,920 --> 01:51:21,606
manipulate governments,
and spy on whomever you choose.

1790
01:51:21,680 --> 01:51:23,523
Also, you could, as you said,

1791
01:51:23,600 --> 01:51:26,763
control the public
from outside the grid.

1792
01:51:27,680 --> 01:51:32,971
These men destroy people's lives.

1793
01:51:33,080 --> 01:51:37,130
Spying on the world, robbing you
of your right to privacy.

1794
01:51:37,200 --> 01:51:40,443
And they do that
by hiding in the dark.

1795
01:51:40,520 --> 01:51:45,082
So, in the Horsemen tradition,
we're here to expose them.

1796
01:51:45,160 --> 01:51:50,200
Tonight, they, like all of us,

1797
01:51:50,280 --> 01:51:53,443
are finally stepping into the light.

1798
01:51:57,400 --> 01:51:58,606
Thank you, everybody!

1799
01:51:58,680 --> 01:52:01,286
We are the Horsemen
and we will be back very soon!

1800
01:52:03,600 --> 01:52:07,605
Five, four, three, two, one!

1801
01:52:24,440 --> 01:52:27,046
- Hey, we're on the clock.
- Get a move on.

1802
01:52:30,120 --> 01:52:31,246
There they are!

1803
01:52:31,320 --> 01:52:33,368
- There's more inside.
- Don't you bloody touch me!

1804
01:52:33,440 --> 01:52:35,124
The Horsemen are over on the...

1805
01:52:37,920 --> 01:52:39,365
Oh, shit!

1806
01:52:40,040 --> 01:52:41,849
Stay with them!

1807
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:43,922
Everybody spread out!

1808
01:52:44,000 --> 01:52:45,843
Nobody leaves this barge!

1809
01:52:47,760 --> 01:52:50,843
Rhodes, hold it right there!
Do not move!

1810
01:52:56,520 --> 01:52:58,204
This contains everything.

1811
01:52:58,280 --> 01:53:01,363
Not just Walter and Tressler,
but all their dealings.

1812
01:53:01,440 --> 01:53:04,444
All their contacts,
the entire network.

1813
01:53:04,520 --> 01:53:06,727
And why on Earth
would I believe you?

1814
01:53:06,840 --> 01:53:10,481
I told you.
I'm the same man I've always been.

1815
01:53:10,560 --> 01:53:13,040
Move it! Come on!
Let's go, go, go!

1816
01:53:13,120 --> 01:53:15,930
I'm not part of this
organization! I'm Merritt.

1817
01:53:16,000 --> 01:53:19,209
I'm a patsy!
I'm a patsy!

1818
01:53:20,120 --> 01:53:22,009
Ten minutes.

1819
01:53:23,800 --> 01:53:25,848
Now you're playing
the long game.

1820
01:53:39,720 --> 01:53:41,961
Dad, I promise you I will fix this.

1821
01:53:42,040 --> 01:53:44,407
You can't. Stop calling me dad.

1822
01:53:44,480 --> 01:53:48,405
There were so many women,
I have no idea whose bastard you are.

1823
01:53:48,480 --> 01:53:49,606
What?

1824
01:53:49,680 --> 01:53:52,047
- What happened?
- Thin air, gone. Come with me.

1825
01:53:52,120 --> 01:53:55,761
What're you talking about, gone?
People don't just disappear.

1826
01:53:55,840 --> 01:53:58,571
You realize that he doesn't actually
have magical powers!

1827
01:54:38,240 --> 01:54:39,685
- Hey, guys.
- Hey!

1828
01:54:39,760 --> 01:54:42,161
- Good to see you all.
- Good to see you, Li.

1829
01:54:43,280 --> 01:54:44,406
Come on in.

1830
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:50,524
Good morning. Welcome.

1831
01:54:52,960 --> 01:54:56,521
I'm proud of you.
All of you.

1832
01:54:56,600 --> 01:55:00,127
I have a lot to show you. Come.

1833
01:55:01,360 --> 01:55:02,600
Come.

1834
01:55:13,960 --> 01:55:15,166
Dad.

1835
01:55:32,600 --> 01:55:34,204
Yes.

1836
01:55:34,320 --> 01:55:37,051
Your father and I were partners.

1837
01:55:37,120 --> 01:55:40,283
Our act was that of rivals.

1838
01:55:41,480 --> 01:55:47,123
I was the hard-eyed realist.
He was the dreamy-eyed idealist.

1839
01:55:47,200 --> 01:55:49,931
We thought it was the perfect misdirect.

1840
01:55:51,000 --> 01:55:54,641
Yes, in public, I did goad him.

1841
01:55:54,720 --> 01:55:59,567
The only thing we didn't count on
was it going so wrong.

1842
01:56:03,600 --> 01:56:05,409
Why?

1843
01:56:05,520 --> 01:56:07,249
Why didn't you ever say anything to me?

1844
01:56:07,320 --> 01:56:08,845
I don't know.

1845
01:56:10,000 --> 01:56:11,286
Give it a name.

1846
01:56:11,400 --> 01:56:14,802
Shame, guilt. Regret.

1847
01:56:18,560 --> 01:56:21,530
Hey, guys, you might
wanna come take a look at this.

1848
01:56:25,720 --> 01:56:26,926
Look.

1849
01:56:27,040 --> 01:56:28,804
<i>I put you in jail, man.</i>

1850
01:56:28,880 --> 01:56:31,247
Why didn't you
say something then?

1851
01:56:31,320 --> 01:56:34,324
Well, you know, I was going to.

1852
01:56:34,400 --> 01:56:39,042
But then, you were so quick to show
your personal motivations that...

1853
01:56:40,320 --> 01:56:43,722
Well, quite frankly
it spoiled the trick for me.

1854
01:56:43,800 --> 01:56:45,086
I showed my weakness.

1855
01:56:45,160 --> 01:56:47,970
Well, it showed you weren't ready.

1856
01:56:48,040 --> 01:56:50,691
But when you came back to my cell,

1857
01:56:50,760 --> 01:56:55,163
you had let go of your
30-year vendetta against me...

1858
01:56:56,160 --> 01:56:57,650
...for your Horsemen.

1859
01:56:59,240 --> 01:57:03,928
<i>And I said to myself,
"That's Lionel's boy."</i>

1860
01:57:04,800 --> 01:57:08,202
<i>And I knew it was my job to see to it</i>

1861
01:57:08,280 --> 01:57:12,001
<i>that he became the magician
he was born to be.</i>

1862
01:57:12,080 --> 01:57:14,401
All that was left then was...

1863
01:57:16,160 --> 01:57:17,491
For me to hit bottom.

1864
01:57:18,280 --> 01:57:23,127
So the safe, my father's wristwatch,
that was all you?

1865
01:57:25,920 --> 01:57:29,242
<i>Walter and Tressler,
were they in on it too?</i>

1866
01:57:29,320 --> 01:57:32,164
<i>Oh, we knew
Walter was in hiding.</i>

1867
01:57:32,240 --> 01:57:35,961
<i>The Octa show was a setup
to expose him to the public.</i>

1868
01:57:39,000 --> 01:57:41,128
<i>And you were right
about the Horsemen.</i>

1869
01:57:41,240 --> 01:57:46,280
<i>They needed to learn to work together
like a single organism.</i>

1870
01:57:53,960 --> 01:57:56,566
Now I know why
you look so familiar.

1871
01:57:56,640 --> 01:57:58,244
You're the Horsemen, aren't you?

1872
01:58:05,960 --> 01:58:07,371
Okay.

1873
01:58:07,440 --> 01:58:09,488
<i>But that can't be
what all this is about.</i>

1874
01:58:09,600 --> 01:58:14,083
You know, the best tricks
work on many levels.

1875
01:58:14,160 --> 01:58:18,131
And the deepest one,
for me, at least,

1876
01:58:18,200 --> 01:58:21,010
is this moment right here.

1877
01:58:24,640 --> 01:58:26,165
I'm sorry, Dylan.

1878
01:58:26,800 --> 01:58:29,326
I miss your father.

1879
01:58:29,400 --> 01:58:32,882
Thirty years is a long time to drag
something around, isn't it?

1880
01:58:33,000 --> 01:58:34,650
Yes, it is.

1881
01:58:44,600 --> 01:58:45,886
So, now what?

1882
01:58:48,320 --> 01:58:51,210
- Now I'm about out of moves.
- Oh...

1883
01:58:51,280 --> 01:58:52,645
And I'm tired.

1884
01:58:52,720 --> 01:58:55,041
Come on, you're the one who said
that you believe that this road

1885
01:58:55,120 --> 01:58:57,088
led to the great wizard
behind the curtain.

1886
01:58:57,160 --> 01:58:58,207
I did.

1887
01:58:58,280 --> 01:59:00,442
And that you'd finally
get to look him in the eyes.

1888
01:59:01,840 --> 01:59:03,524
I am.

1889
01:59:09,320 --> 01:59:11,766
It's your game now.

1890
01:59:11,840 --> 01:59:14,446
You play it however you see fit.

1891
01:59:15,680 --> 01:59:21,528
My suggestion, however, is that
you find yourself a successor.

1892
01:59:21,600 --> 01:59:23,489
Hi. Okay, so...

1893
01:59:23,560 --> 01:59:26,882
Well, obviously,
we have a few questions. Right?

1894
01:59:26,960 --> 01:59:29,440
Uh... By "a few,"
I think he means, like, five million.

1895
01:59:29,520 --> 01:59:31,090
- Yeah.
- Well.

1896
01:59:31,160 --> 01:59:33,003
Good luck to you all.

1897
01:59:33,080 --> 01:59:34,730
- Okay. See, that's not fair.
- What!

1898
01:59:34,800 --> 01:59:35,881
- Come on.
- That's not right.

1899
01:59:35,960 --> 01:59:37,246
That's gonna make me really angry!

1900
01:59:37,320 --> 01:59:38,526
Not right now.

1901
01:59:38,600 --> 01:59:40,204
Oh, by the way...

1902
01:59:42,440 --> 01:59:44,920
Pay no attention to the curtain.

1903
01:59:47,840 --> 01:59:49,205
There is a curtain.

1904
01:59:49,280 --> 01:59:50,611
Go, go, go.

1905
02:00:00,000 --> 02:00:04,449
<i>Seeing is believing.
But is it truth?</i>

1906
02:00:04,520 --> 02:00:07,171
<i>Depends on your point of view.</i>

1907
02:00:07,240 --> 02:00:09,766
<i>Are you listening, Horsemen?</i>

1908
02:00:09,840 --> 02:00:14,164
<i>When you emerge, and you will,</i>

1909
02:00:14,240 --> 02:00:17,369
<i>I will be there waiting.</i>

1910
02:00:17,480 --> 02:00:23,044
<i>Because mark my words,
you will get what's coming to you</i>

1911
02:00:23,120 --> 02:00:25,771
<i>in ways you can't expect.</i>

1912
02:00:26,640 --> 02:00:29,325
<i>But very much deserve.</i>

1913
02:00:29,400 --> 02:00:32,529
<i>Because one thing I believe in</i>

1914
02:00:32,600 --> 02:00:36,491
<i>is an eye for an eye.</i>
